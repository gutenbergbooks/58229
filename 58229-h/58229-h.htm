<p>DEDICATION,</p>

<p>TO HER MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY,</p>

<p>QUEEN ADELAIDE</p>


<hr class="r10" />


<h2>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY,</h2>

<p>To pen a dedication skilfully is
generally the most difficult part of an Author's
task; but a dedication to ROYALTY is so
delicate a matter, that I almost tremble for
the success of my undertaking&mdash;tremble lest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv"> iv </a></span>
I should fail to express myself dutifully,
gratefully, properly; though I am not without
hope that your Majesty's goodness
will graciously extend to the Author that
degree of indulgence of which he is sensible
he stands so much in need, especially as
nothing unbecoming a dutiful subject to
write, or improper for a gracious Sovereign
to read, is intended to be here expressed.</p>

<p>As, however, every colony of Bees, wherever
domiciled, whether in a box, or in a
cottage-hive, in the roof of a house, or in the
trunk of a hollow-tree, is under an admirable
government, the presiding head and Sovereign
of which is a QUEEN,&mdash;as no colony of
Bees, deprived of its QUEEN, ever prospers,
or long survives such loss,&mdash;as this insect
government, or government of insects,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v"> v </a></span>
exhibits to man the most perfect pattern of
devoted attachment, and of true allegiance
on the part of the subject Bees to their
Sovereign, and of industry, ingenuity, prosperity,
and apparently of general happiness
in their well-ordered state,&mdash;and as these
most curious and valuable little creatures
have hitherto been most cruelly treated&mdash;have
been, and still are, annually sacrificed
by millions, for the sake of their sweet
treasure; I do feel a pleasure, and think
there is a sort of analogical propriety, in
dedicating to your Gracious Majesty this
work, the leading feature of which is&mdash;Humanity
to Honey-Bees. Under your
Majesty's fostering and influential Patronage,
I cannot but anticipate that this object will
be essentially promoted, and that the management
of Bees, in this country at least,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"> vi </a></span>
will not hereafter reflect disgrace upon their
owners.</p>

<p>In this pleasing hope, I humbly beg to
subscribe myself,</p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">YOUR MAJESTY's<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">most dutiful</span><br />

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>



<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">Could</span> I disarm criticism as easily as I can
deprive Bees of their power to sting, this
would be the proper place to do so; though I
am doubtful whether it would be well-judged
in me, or to my advantage, to stay the critics'
pen. But, possessing no such talismanic
power, I shall adventure my little book into
the world, without any attempt to conciliate
the critics' good-will, or to provoke their
animosity, conscious that from <i>fair</i> criticism
I have nothing to fear. That I shall be
attacked by those apiarians who are wedded
to their own theories and systems, however
faulty, is no more than I expect: of them, I
trust, I have nowhere spoken disparagingly;
towards none of them do I entertain unkindly
feelings&mdash;far otherwise. Their number, I
am led to believe, is not formidable; and as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"> viii </a></span>
gentlemen, and fellow-labourers in the same
work of humanity, their more extensive learning
will hardly be brought to bear against me
with rancour and violence. Should any one
of them, or of any other class of writers, so far
degrade himself, I shall have the advantage
of the following preliminary observation, viz.
that one set of my collateral-boxes, placed in
a favourable situation, and <i>duly and properly
attended to</i>, for one season only, will outweigh
all the learning and arguments that can be
adduced against my Bee-practice,&mdash;will be
proof positive, visible, tangible, that there is
in my pretensions something more than empty
boast. Luckily for me, there are plenty of
those proofs to be met with in the country, and
there are some&mdash;several, not far from town;
they are at Blackheath, at Kensington, at
Clapham, and at other places. As hundreds
of the Nobility and Gentry of this country
will recollect, there was one of these incontrovertible
proofs of the truth of what I am
stating, exhibited for several weeks at the
National Repository last autumn, where it was
seen, examined, admired, and, I may without
any exaggeration add, <i>universally approved</i>.
Practice, which has resulted from more than
ten years' experience in the management of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix"> ix </a></span>
apiary, and from innumerable experiments,
carried on, and a hundred times repeated,
during that period, is what I ground the
utility of my discoveries upon. To theory I
lay no claim. Born and brought up in the
fens of Lincolnshire, where I have spent the
greater part of my life amidst difficulties,
misfortunes, and hardships, of which I will
not here complain, though I am still smarting
under the effects of some of them, my pretensions
to learning are but small: for, though
sent to the respectable Grammar School at
Horncastle in my boyhood, my education was
not extended beyond writing, arithmetic, and
merchants' accompts. As soon as it was
thought that I had acquired a competent
knowledge of these useful branches of education,
it was my lot to be bound apprentice to
learn the trades and mysteries of grocer,
draper, and tallow-chandler. Whilst endeavouring
to gain an honest livelihood as a
grocer and draper, at Moulton-Chapel, in
1822, I was afflicted with a severe illness,
which, after long-protracted suffering, left me
as helpless as a child, the natural use and
strength of my limbs being gone; and, though
supported by and tottering between my
crutches, it was a long time before I was able
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x"> x </a></span>
to crawl into my garden. Fatigued and
exhausted with the exercise of journeying
the length of a garden-walk of no great
extent, it was my custom to rest my wearied
limbs upon a bench placed near my Bees.
Seated on that bench, I used to while away
the lingering hours as best I could, ruminating
now on this subject, now on that, just as my
fancy chanced to fix. Among other things my
Bees one day caught my attention: I watched
their busy movements,&mdash;their activity pleased
me,&mdash;their humming noise long-listened to
became music to my ears, and I often fancied
that I heard it afterwards when I was away
from them. In short, I became fond of
them and of their company, and visited them
as often as the weather and my feebleness
would permit. When kept from them a day
or two, I felt uneasy, and less comfortable than
when I could get to them. The swarming
season arrived; and with it ideas took possession
of my mind which had not until then
possessed it:&mdash;I conceived that swarming was
an act more of necessity than of choice,&mdash;that
as such it was an evil; but how to provide
a remedy for it&mdash;how to prevent it&mdash;was a
problem that then puzzled me. I studied it
for a long time, and to very little purpose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi"> xi </a></span>
The old-fashioned method of eking did not
by any means satisfy my mind; it might
answer the purpose for one season, but how
to proceed the next did not appear. Then the
time for taking honey was approaching: to
get at that treasure without destroying my
little friends that had collected it, and that
had, moreover, so often soothed me in my
sorrow and my sufferings, was another problem
that long engaged my mind. After some years'
unremitted attention to my Bees, for I had
formed a sort of attachment to them during
the first stage of my convalescence, which
never left me, an accident aided my studies
by directing my attention to the effects of
ventilation, as will be found related in the
body of this work, and I began to make
experiments, which being repeated, varied,
improved, and then gone through again, have
gradually led to the development of my improved
mode of Bee-management, attempted
to be explained in the following pages.</p>

<p>At the time I have been speaking of, I had
not read one single book on Bees; nor had I
then one in my possession. Whatever my
practice may be, it has resulted from my own
unaided experience and discoveries. To books
I am not indebted for any part of it: nay, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii"> xii </a></span>
I begun to attempt to improve the system of
Bee-management by books, I verily believe, I
never should have improved it at all, nor have
made one useful discovery. <i>The Bees themselves
have been my instructors.</i> After I had
so far succeeded as to have from my apiary
glasses and boxes of honey of a superior
quality, to exhibit at the National Repository,
where, with grateful thanks to the Managers
of that Institution for their kindness to me, I
was encouraged to persevere, Bee-books in
profusion were presented to me, some of them
by friends with names, some by friends whose
names I have yet to learn. I have read them
all: but nowhere find, in any of them, clear,
practical directions, how honey of the very
purest quality, and in more considerable
quantity than by any of the plans heretofore
proposed, may be taken from Bees, without
recourse to any suffocation whatever, or any
other violent means;&mdash;how all the Bees may
be preserved uninjured;&mdash;and how swarming
may be prevented. These are the grand
features in my plan; and minute directions
for the accomplishment of these most desirable
objects are laid down in this book.</p>

<p>I by no means maintain that my system of
Bee-management is incapable of improvement;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii"> xiii </a></span>
but I do think that the principles upon which
it is founded <i>are right</i>,&mdash;that the foundation
is here properly laid,&mdash;and that every apiarian,
who may hereafter conform to, or improve
upon, my practice, will be instrumental in
contributing a part towards raising the superstructure&mdash;namely&mdash;an
asylum or sanctuary
for Honey-Bees.</p>

<p>I cannot close this preface without acknowledging
myself to be under the greatest
obligations to the Rev. T. Clark, of Gedney-Hill.
But for his assistance the following
work would not have made its appearance in
its present form; if indeed it had appeared at
all. He has revised, corrected, connected,
and arranged the materials of which it is
composed; and he has, moreover, gratuitously
added much that is original and valuable from
his own rich stores of knowledge. To him I
am indebted for the selection of the Latin
mottos. As an apiarian he is one of my most
improved and skilful pupils, and bids fair to
become an ornament to the science of Bee-management.
As a mechanic he is ingenious
enough to make his own Bee-boxes, and has
actually made some of the very best I have
yet seen. To his knowledge of mechanics it
is owing that the description and explanation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv"> xiv </a></span>
of each of the different boxes, of all the other
parts of my Bee-machinery, and of my observatory-hive,
in particular, are more detailed,
clearer, and more intelligible than they would
have been in my hands. As a scholar there
are passages in the following work that afford
no mean specimen of his abilities. I have only
to regret that the reward for the pains he has
taken with it must be my thanks&mdash;that it is
not in my power to remunerate him for his
kind labours more substantially than by this
public acknowledgement of the obligations I
am under, and of my sense of the debt of
gratitude that is due to him.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_THE_SECOND_EDITION" id="PREFACE_TO_THE_SECOND_EDITION">PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</a></h2>


<p class="p0">"<span class="smcap">Out of print</span>," though a somewhat laconic,
might be a not inappropriate preface to this
second edition, and of itself a quaint apology
for its appearance. <i>Out of print</i> is certainly
exhilarating news to the author anxious for the
success of a work inculcating a new system
of Bee-management, in which not only is his
reputation as an apiarian involved and evolved,
but, it may be, the very means of his subsistence
are <i>bound up</i> in it; the oftener therefore
he hears the bibliopolist expression&mdash;<i>out of
print</i>&mdash;the more animating and welcome it
becomes; because its reiteration can hardly
fail to be considered by him an indication
that the demand for his book continues.&mdash;that
his system is progressing,&mdash;or, at any rate, that
either curiosity respecting it, or some higher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi"> xvi </a></span>
and more laudable motive, is still existent in
the public mind. Thus cheered on, thus, as
it were, <i>encored</i>, it has become his duty to the
public no less than to himself to proceed
forthwith to the publication of a new edition.</p>

<p>Previously, however, to stating what alterations,
emendations, &amp;c. have been introduced
in order to render the work, as far as I am
yet able to render it, worthy a continuance of
public patronage, I consider it to be my duty
to record my grateful thanks for the success
and encouragement I have already received.</p>

<p>To the scientific and literary press, and to
the several gentlemen of scientific attainments
connected therewith, who, by their influence
and kind professional assistance, and promptitude
in the furtherance of my interest, have
greatly contributed to my success, my best
thanks are due, <i>and are hereby respectfully
tendered:</i> amongst these I have sincere pleasure
in particularizing Dr. <span class="smcap">Birkbeck</span>&mdash;the talented
President of the London Mechanics' Institution,&mdash;Dr.
<span class="smcap">Hancock</span>&mdash;Fellow of the Medico-Botanical
Society&mdash;a veteran of high and

<p>To J. C. London&mdash;the erudite editor of the
Gardeners' Magazine,&mdash;to E. J. Robertson,
Esq.&mdash;the able and ingenious editor of the
Mechanics' Magazine,&mdash;to Richard Newcomb&mdash;the
editor and publisher of the Stamford
Mercury,&mdash;and to the several editors of the
Metropolitan and Provincial Press, who have
made favourable mention of my labours, my
public thanks are justly due,&mdash;and particularly
to the editor of the Cambridge Quarterly
Review, for a highly commendatory notice of
my work, evidently written by a practical
apiarian, and with competent knowledge of
his subject, which appeared in No. 3 of that
Review, published in March 1834. Also to
my long-tried, worthy <i>Friend</i>&mdash;George Neighbour&mdash;it
is gratifying to me to have this
opportunity of offering my sincere thanks for
his valuable services in my behalf;&mdash;and to
the conductors of those excellent and useful
institutions&mdash;the National Gallery of Practical
Science, Adelaide Street,&mdash;and the Museum
of National Manufactures, Leicester Square,
London, I gratefully acknowledge myself to
be under no slight obligations for the advantageous
opportunities which I have there
possessed of extending the knowledge of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii"> xviii </a></span>
system, and of exhibiting, year after year, to
thousands of visitors, the products of my
apiary.</p>

<p>With the view of making "The Humane
Management of Honey-Bees" more interesting,
the dialogue, which formed the introductory
chapter in the first edition, has been withdrawn,
and in its place have been substituted some
valuable remarks of Dr. Birkbeck, Dr. Hancock,
and Mr. Booth, respecting Bees, honey, wax,
&amp;c. of course <i>the <a href="#CHAPTER_I">first chapter</a> is new</i>; as is
<a href="#CHAPTER_X">chapter X.</a> giving an account of the apiary of
the Most Noble the Marquess of Blandford, at
Delabere Park, which can hardly fail of being
interesting to every reader: it is principally
from the able pen of Mr. Booth. <a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII">Chapter
XVIII.</a> on Apiarian Societies, is new also.
And, besides these three entire chapters, not
short paragraphs merely, but whole pages of
new matter have been introduced interspersedly
by my most respected friend&mdash;the Rev. T. Clark,
of Gedney-Hill, who has revised, corrected,
and re-arranged the whole; and who has not
only bestowed much time and pains upon the
improvement of my work, but in the kindest
and most disinterested manner has, in superintending
this and the former edition through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix"> xix </a></span>
the press, actually travelled upwards of <i>eight
hundred</i> miles. The friendly performer of
services so generous, so laborious, and so perseveringly
attended to, without any stipulation
for fee or reward, merits from me, and has
from me, every expression of my gratitude,
and, were it in my power, should have <i>one
expression more</i>.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> object of the generality of persons who
keep Bees, is&mdash;profit: and that profit might
be indefinitely augmented were Bees properly
managed, and their lives preserved&mdash;were the
still extensively-practised, cruel, and destructive
system superseded by a conservative one.
Some few there may be in the higher ranks
of life, who cultivate bees from motives of
curiosity&mdash;for the gratification of witnessing
and examining the formation and progress of
their ingenious and most beautiful works, and
with a view to study the instinct, habits,
propensities, peculiarities, or, in one word, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"> 2 </a></span>
nature, of these wonderful, little insects, in
order to improve their condition, and to gain
additional knowledge respecting their natural
history, hitherto, it must be confessed, enveloped
in much uncertainty, and very imperfectly understood.
To this class of Bee-masters and
<i>Bee-friends</i> the system of management to be
explained in the following pages, will, it is
hoped, unfold discoveries and impart facilities
and improvements hitherto unknown in apiarian
science. And they, whose sole object in
keeping Bees is <i>profit</i>, may derive incalculable
advantage from conforming to the mode of
management, and strictly attending to the
<i>practical directions</i> hereinafter to be detailed:
because as their profits are expected to arise
principally from honey and wax, it evidently
must be for their interest to know how to obtain
those valuable Bee-productions in their purest
state and in the greatest quantity. The quantity
obtained in a good honey-year (viz. 1826)
from a well-stocked and exceedingly prosperous
colony&mdash;still in existence, and still flourishing,
(i. e. in 1834) was so considerable, and so far
beyond anything ever realized from a common
straw-hive colony, that my statements respecting
it have been doubted by some, and totally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"> 3 </a></span>
discredited by others, unacquainted with my
(I trust I may say) <i>improved</i> system of Bee-management.
With respect to the purity of
the honey taken according to my plan, and
the general properties and medical virtues,
and, of course, <i>value of honey when pure</i>, I
have much pleasure in being enabled to submit
to the reader the opinions of my scientific
friends&mdash;Dr. Birkbeck, Mr. Abraham Booth,
Lecturer on Chemistry, and Dr. Hancock;
because their opinions may safely be considered
as unimpeachable authority on this subject,
viz. the uses and medical virtues of <i>pure
honey</i>.</p>

<p>In some observations on the effect of the
temperature of Bee-hives on the quality of
honey, published in a scientific journal, Mr.
Booth observes&mdash;"notwithstanding the adequate
justice which has been done to Mr. Nutt's
improved and admirable system of Bee-management,
there is one point which does not
appear to have elicited much attention&mdash;the
superiority in quality both of the honey and
the wax. It does not appear to me that the
whole of this superiority consists in freedom
from extraneous animal or vegetable matters,
a point of very great importance, however, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"> 4 </a></span>
its dietetic purposes are concerned; but that
it greatly depends upon the modified degree
of temperature at which the Bees effect their
labours, and which is insufficient to produce
any chemical changes in the constitution of
these substances; whereas under the old
system, the continued high temperature of
the hive is sufficient to induce those changes
which impart the colour that so materially
deteriorates the quality as well as the value of
the products. <i>From Mr. Nutt's hives we obtain
pure honey, as it is actually secreted by the Bee</i>,
which cannot be ensured by any other mode of
management."</p>

<p>To my very intelligent friend and patron,
Dr. Birkbeck, whose uniform liberality and
kindness, from the infancy of my pursuits,
I have reason to appreciate, I am indebted for
introducing this subject in a Lecture<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> at the
London Institution, Moorfields, on the application
of the oxy-hydrogen light to illustrate
the economy and structure of the insect world.
In the course of his observations, on referring
to the tongue of the Bee, the learned Doctor
made copious allusions to my system, and the
advantages which would in his view result
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"> 5 </a></span>
from its general extension. He observed that
"so small is the supply that we derive from
the labours of Bees in this country, that the
production of wax does not even more than
equal its consumption in the simple article of
lip-salve. Under this improved system, we
may however hope that the advantages of Bee-management
may be more generally diffused
throughout the kingdom,&mdash;that Bee-hives will
be multiplied, and that the choicest flowers of
the field and forest will no longer 'waste their
sweetness in the desert air.' In a dietetic
point of view, it is of great importance that a
saccharine, secreted by one of the most beautiful
processes of nature, should be substituted
for one produced by the most imperfect and
complicated process of art, whilst the more
salutary properties of the former would recommend
it as far more eligible for use. He could
not but hope that, in this view the system
would soon receive that extension in practice
to which its merits fitted it."<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> Dr. Birkbeck related the following instance of the power
of recognition possessed by Bees to myself and Mr. Booth,
which I cannot suffer to pass unnoticed. When a boy, he was
accustomed to cover his hand with honey, and go to the front
of one of the hives in his father's garden. His hand was soon
covered by the Bees, banquetting on the proffered sweets, and
the whole of it was speedily removed. The Bees appeared
to recognize the learned Doctor ever afterwards when he appeared
in the garden, his hand being always surrounded by
them in expectation of there finding their accustomed boon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> 6 </a></span></p></div>

<p>Some very important observations on honey,
in a medical point of view, are those which
were contained in a paper written by my very
learned and valued friend, Dr. Hancock, and
read before the Medico-Botanical Society at
their sitting November 26th 1833.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

which constitutes him a corresponding member thereof.</p></div>

<p>An abstract of this important paper<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> I shall

<p>"The great objects which recommend Mr.
Nutt's plan, consist in the great improvement
in quality and augmentation of honey produced,
and that without destroying the Bees&mdash;a
discovery equally creditable to Mr. Nutt, as
a man of benevolent mind, and to his industry
and indefatigable research.</p>

<p>"The cultivation of Honey-bees is of remote
antiquity. The Bee was regarded as the emblem
of royalty with the ancient Egyptians,
and Bees have been held in the highest esteem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"> 7 </a></span>
by all nations, whether barbarous or civilized;
yet the united experience of ancients and
moderns has never hitherto led to the happy
results, which, by a connected series of experiments,
patient research, and logical induction,
have in twelve years been achieved by Mr.
Nutt. In the course of his observation he saw,
not only that the destruction of the Bees was
barbarous in the extreme, but that this cruelty
was equally subversive of the crops of honey;
his inquiries were hence directed to find how
this destructive system could be exchanged
for a conservative one. In this he has completely
succeeded, and by preserving the Bees
has been enabled to increase their produce
many-fold, and that too, in a far more salutary
and improved quality. It is equal even to the
samples usually obtained from young hives
called virgin honey, which is scarce, dear, and
seldom to be had genuine.</p>

<p>"Owing to the want of knowledge on the
subject, the consequent impurities, and the
great price of foreign honey, together with the
adulterations practised, the use of this valuable
article has been nearly abandoned in this
country, whether as an article of the materia
medica or of domestic economy; and for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"> 8 </a></span>
reasons just stated, the preparations of honey
have even been expunged from the Edinburgh
Pharmacopeia. From the recent improvement,
however, by the gentleman just mentioned, we
have reason to hope its use will be restored in
a condition vastly improved, and that at a great
reduction in price, the facilities of production
being greatly enhanced, and such as to render
it in time available to all classes of society.</p>

<p>"Pure honey was justly considered by the
ancients to possess the most valuable balsamic
and pectoral properties&mdash;as a lenitive, ecoprotic,
and detergent; and it is well-known to
dissolve viscid phlegm and promote expectoration.
As a medium for other remedies, it is
in its pure state far superior to sirups, as being
less liable to run into the acetous fermentation.
It appears that honey procured on Mr. Nutt's
plan is not excelled by the finest and most
costly samples from the continent, as that of
Minorca, Narbonne, or Montpelier. The various
impurities and extraneous matter usually
contained in honey, cause it in many cases to
produce griping pains, or uneasy sensations in
the stomach and bowels; this however has no
such effect, unless it be taken to an imprudent
extent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"> 9 </a></span></p>

<p>"Pure honey, though in its ultimate elements
similar to refined sugar, yet differs considerably
in its physiological effects on the body, being
a <i>lenitive</i>, <i>aperient</i> or gentle laxative, and hence
incomparably more beneficial in costive habits.
It has in a dietetic or medicinal point of view
been recommended in gravel or calculous complaints;
of this however I have no knowledge,
but its utility in asthma I have experienced in
my own person as well as in others;&mdash;as also
as an efficacious remedy in hooping cough,
taken with antimonial wine, camphor, arid
opium. For sedentary persons and those
troubled with constipation of the bowels,
there is no dietetic or medicinal substance so
useful as pure honey, whether taken in drink
or with bread and butter, &amp;c. It is well-known
as a detergent of foul sores, and I have often
found it to succeed in healing deep-seated
sinuous or fistulous ulcers, and thus to obviate
the necessity of surgical operations.</p>

<p>"In South America and amongst the Spaniards,
honey is considered as one of the best
detergents for sloughing sores and foul ulcerations;
so it was formerly in Europe. Its uses
in a surgical point of view have in this country
long been lost sight of. Its detergent power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"> 10 </a></span>
is such, that it was formerly denominated a
<i>vegetable soap</i>, as we may see in the older
writers. It is still made the basis of <i>cosmetics</i>,
and this empirical practice goes to prove its
efficacy&mdash;to those at least who have experienced
its effects in cleansing and healing sinuous
ulcers, its stimulating property producing
withal the sanitary adhesive inflammation. A
species of wine made from honey, called
metheglin and mead&mdash;the <i>mulsum</i> of the ancients&mdash;was
formerly much in use in this
country, and most deservedly so from its
pleasant taste and salutary properties. By
the perfection of honey, this may now be
obtained no doubt of equal excellence here,
and a rich mellifluous species of wine of the
most wholesome kind will be acquired, and
open a new source of national industry.</p>

<p>"It has been said, that where the air is
clear and hot, honey is better than where it is
variable and cold, and this seems to have served
as an apology for the inferiority of much of the
honey contained in this country. It is a
position, which I am persuaded is not well
founded; for the honey in hot climates, notwithstanding
the fragrance of the flowers, is
mostly inferior to the commonest samples
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"> 11 </a></span>
produced here. This inferiority, however,
may be entirely owing to the difference in the
Bees&mdash;for I speak here of the wild or native
honey&mdash;and it is probable that the <i>apis mellifica</i>
might, in South America, on Mr. Nutt's plan,
produce the best of honey, and in very great
abundance, because it would there work all
the year, and the product therefore would be
greatly increased.</p>

<p>"I have seen honey taken in the forests of
South America from several different species
of Bees; they were always destitute of a sting,
although entomologists consider it as one of
the generic characters of <i>apis</i>. It is also
singular that their wax is always <i>black</i>, or dark
brown, although the pollen of the flowers,
which is said to give colour, is equally yellow
as in this country. Bees obtain honey from
most kinds of flowers, but appear in general
to prefer the labiati or lip flowers, as those of
sage, marjoram, mint, thyme, lavender, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Mr. Nutt, in the course of his observation,
has noticed the curious fact, that the nectar
or honey obtained from different plants is
carefully deposited by the Bees in separate
cells, or at least that the nectar from
different <i>genera</i> of plants is kept distinct.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"> 12 </a></span>
It appears indeed, that the produce of the
flowers is classed by them, and arranged with
a precision not inferior to that of the most
accurate botanist. What but a hand Divine
could guide these little insects thus to mock
the boasted power of human reason! This
consideration too, coupled with our own interests,
should operate as a powerful argument in
favour of Mr. Nutt's new conservative system
of management, and against the reckless destruction
of the Bees. Mr. Nutt has already
been patronised by the Royal Family and
several of the nobility, and no doubt his plan
will be adopted by all persons of intelligence,
who engage in this pursuit, whether for profit
or the most rational amusement."</p>

<p>When I first entered into my apiarian
pursuits, I felt convinced of the great and
profitable extent to which they might be
carried; and of this I have been all along since
confirmed as success has crowned my efforts.
If I could demonstrate&mdash;and I have repeatedly
demonstrated&mdash;how much honey might be increased
in quantity, its superior quality also
struck me as a point of no less importance;
and in this I am now most satisfactorily
confirmed by the sanction of those scientific
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"> 13 </a></span>
friends whose valuable opinions have been
above quoted. With alacrity and pleasure I
will therefore proceed, without further introduction,
to give a description of my Bee-boxes,
and other hives, and of all my Bee-machinery,&mdash;and
directions for the proper construction
of them,&mdash;and also for the proper ordering
and management of Bees in them.</p>

<p class="caption3">BEE-BOXES AND MANAGEMENT OF BEES IN THEM.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> schemes and contrivances, and ways and
means, to which apiarians have had recourse,
in order to deprive Bees of their honey, without
at the same time destroying their lives,
have been various, and some of them ingenious;
but hitherto not one of them has been crowned
with the desired success. The leaf-hives of
Dunbar and of Huber&mdash;Huish's hive with
cross-bars,&mdash;the piling of hive upon hive, or
box upon box, (called storifying), and several
other contrivances, have all had this great
object in view,&mdash;have all had their patrons
and admirers,&mdash;have all had fair trials,&mdash;but
have, notwithstanding, all failed of fully accomplishing
it.</p>

<p>Whether my inventions may merit and may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"> 15 </a></span>
meet with a similar or with a better fate, it is
not for me to predict,&mdash;time will show. I
feel warranted, however, in asserting of my
COLLATERAL-BOX-HIVE, which I am
now about to explain,&mdash;of my INVERTED-HIVE,
and of my OBSERVATORY-HIVE,
of which in their proper places minute descriptions
will be given,&mdash;I feel, I say, warranted
in asserting that these&mdash;my inventions&mdash;possess
such conveniences and accommodations
both for Bees and Bee-masters, that the pure
treasure stored in them by those industrious,
little insects may at any time be abstracted
from them, not only without destroying the
Bees, but without injuring them in the least,
or even incommoding their labours by the
operation;&mdash;that they afford accommodations
to the Bees which greatly accelerate the progress
of their labours in the summer-season;&mdash;and
that the Bees never leave them in disgust,
as it were, as they not unfrequently <i>do leave</i>
other hives, after being deprived of their
stores; but, as if nothing had happened to
them, continue day by day to accumulate fresh
treasures, the quantity of which has astonished
the beholders, and not only the quantity, but
the quality also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"> 16 </a></span></p>

<p>That my boxes do not, admit of improvement
is more than I assert; but having worked
them most successfully for many years, and
knowing that several other persons, following
my directions, have succeeded with them as
well as myself, and far beyond their most
sanguine expectations, I do flatter myself that
the principle of managing Bees after my plan
is right.</p>

<p>The plates here presented to my readers
exhibit a set of my collateral Bee-boxes open,
and every compartment exposed to view, especially
to the view and for the examination
of experienced workmen. I make use of the
word <i>experienced</i>, because the better the boxes
are made, the more certain will the apiarian
be of success in the management of his Bees
in them.</p>

<p>There has been some difference of opinion as
to the most suitable dimensions for Bee-boxes.
I approve of and recommend those which are
from eleven to twelve inches square inside,
and nine or ten inches deep in the clear.</p>

<p>The best wood for them is by some said to be
red cedar; the chief grounds of preference of
which wood are&mdash;its effects in keeping moths
out of the boxes, and its being a bad conductor
of heat. But of whatever kind of wood Bee-boxes
are made, it should be well seasoned,
perfectly sound, and free from what carpenters
term <i>shakes</i>. Good, sound, red deal answers
the purpose very well, and is the sort of wood
of which most of my boxes have been made
hitherto. The sides of the boxes, particularly
the front sides, should be at the least an inch
and a half in thickness; for the ends, top,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"> 19 </a></span>
and back-part, good deal one inch thick is
sufficiently substantial; the ends, that form the
interior divisions and openings, must be of
half-inch stuff, well dressed off, so that, when
the boxes and the dividing-tins are closed, that
is, when they are all placed together, the two
adjoining ends should not exceed five-eighths
of an inch in thickness. These communication-ends,
the bars of which should be exactly
parallel with each other, form a communication,
or a division, as the case may require, which is
very important to the Bees, and by which the
said boxes can be immediately divided without
injuring any part of the combs, or deluging
the Bees with the liquid honey, which so
frequently annoys them, by extracting their
sweets from the piled or storified boxes.</p>

<p>This is not the only advantage my boxes
possess: the receptacles or frame-work for the
ventilators, which appear upon each of the
end-boxes,&mdash;the one with the cover off, the
other with it on&mdash;must be four inches square,
with a perforated, flat tin of nearly the same
size, and in the middle of that tin must be a
round hole, to correspond with the hole through
the top of the box, and in the centre of the
frame-work just mentioned, an inch in diameter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"> 20 </a></span>
to admit the perforated, cylinder, tin ventilator,
nine inches long. This flat tin must have a
smooth piece of wood well-made to fit it closely,
and to cover the frame-work just mentioned,
so as to carry the wet off it, then placing this
cover over the square, perforated tin, your box
will be secure from the action of wind and rain.
The perforated cylinder serves both for a ventilator,
and also for a secure and convenient
receptacle for a thermometer, at any time when
it is necessary to ascertain the temperature of
the box into which the cylinder is inserted.
Within this frame-work, and so that the
perforated, flat tin already described may
completely cover them, at each corner make a
hole with a three-eighths centre-bit through
the top of the box. These four small holes
materially assist the ventilation, and are, in
fact, an essential part of it.</p>

<p>We next come to the long floor, on which
the three square Bee-boxes, (A. C. C.), which
constitute <i>a set</i>, stand collaterally. This floor
is the strong top of a long, shallow box, made
for the express purpose of supporting the
three Bee-boxes, and must, of course, be
superficially of such dimensions as those boxes,
when placed collaterally, require; or, if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"> 21 </a></span>
Bee-boxes project the eighth part of an inch
over the ends and back of this floor-box, so
much the better; because in that case the rain
or wet, that may at any time fall upon them,
will drain off completely. For ornament, as
much as for use, this floor is made to project
about two inches in front; but this projection
must be sloped, or made an inclined plane, so
as to carry off the wet from the front of the
boxes. To the centre of this projecting front,
and on a plane with the edge of the part cut
away for the entrance of the Bees into the
pavilion, is attached the alighting-board, which
consists of a piece of planed board, six inches
by three, having the two outward corners
rounded off a little. The passage from this
alighting-board into the pavilion, (not seen in
the plate, it being at the centre of the side
not shown) is cut, not out of the edge of the
box, <i>but out of the floor-board</i>, and should be
not less than four inches in length, and about
half an inch in depth; or so as to make a
clear half-inch-way under the edge of the
box for the Bee-passage. I recommend this
as preferable to a cut in the edge of the
box,&mdash;because, being upon an inclined plane,
if at any time the wet should be driven into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"> 22 </a></span>
the pavilion by a stormy wind, it would soon
drain out, and the floor become dry; whereas,
if the entrance-passage be cut out of the box,
the rain that may, and at times will, be drifted
in, will be kept in, and the floor be wet for
days, and perhaps for weeks, and be very
detrimental to the Bees. In depth the floor-box,
measured from outside to outside, should
be four inches, so that, if made of three-fourths
inch-deal, there may be left for the depth of the
box-part full two inches and a half. Internally
it is divided into three equal compartments,
being one for each Bee-box: admission to
these compartments, or under-boxes, is by the
drawer and drawer-fronts, or blocks, which
will be described presently.</p>

<p>The bottom, or open edge of each of the
boxes, (A. C. C.) should be well planed, and
made so even and square that they will sit
closely and firmly upon the aforesaid floor,
and be as air-tight as a good workman can
make them, or, technically expressed, <i>be a
dead fit</i> all round. In the floor-board are made
three small openings, i. e. one near the back
of each box. These openings are of a semi-lunar
shape, (though any other shape would
do as well) the straight side of which should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"> 23 </a></span>
not exceed three inches in length, and will be
most convenient if made parallel with the
back-edge of the box, and about an inch from
it. They are covered by perforated, or by
close tin-slides, as the circumstances of your
apiary may require. The drawer (G.) the
front of which appears under the middle-box,
is of great importance, because it affords one
of the greatest accommodations to the Bees
in the boxes. In this drawer is placed, if
necessity require it, a tin made to fit it, and
in that tin, another thin frame covered with
book-muslin, or other fine strainer, which
floats on the liquid deposited for the sustenance
of the Bees. Here, then, you have a feeder,
containing the prepared sweet, in the immediate
vicinity of the mother-hive, and without admitting
the cold or the robbers to annoy the
Bees. When you close the drawer thus prepared
with Bee-food, you must draw out the tin
placed over the semi-lunar aperture, which
will open to the Bees a way to their food in
the drawer beneath. The heat of the hive
follows the Bees into the feeding apartment,
which soon becomes the temperature of their
native-hive. Here the Bees banquet on the
proffered boon in the utmost security, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"> 24 </a></span>
the temperature of their native domicile.
Under such favourable circumstances it is an
idle excuse, not to say&mdash;a want of humanity,
to suffer your Bees to die for want of attention
to proper feeding.</p>

<p>I now come to notice the use of the block-fronts
on each side of the feeding-drawer,
marked G. These two block-fronts answer
many good purposes, and furnish the apiarian
with several practical advantages: first, in the
facility they afford of adding numbers to the
establishment, as occasion may require, which
is done without the least inconvenience or
trouble to the apiarian, and without the least
resentment from the native Bees; second, in
affording to the Bees a place of egress when
you are about to take from them one of the
end-boxes; third, in the effectual and beautiful
guard they furnish against robbers: for
instead of the solid block, seen in the plate,
a safety-block (of which a description will be
given presently) may be substituted, which is
so contrived that ten thousand Bees can with
ease leave their prison and their sweets in the
possession of the humane apiarian, without
the possible chance of a single intruder forcing
its entrance to rob the magazine or to annoy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"> 25 </a></span>
the apiarian. Perhaps this is the most pleasing
part, and the most happy convenience attached
to the boxes. Its origin was this: Whilst
explaining to some scientific gentlemen at the
National Repository the method to be pursued
in the management of Bees in a set of collateral-boxes,&mdash;and,
in particular, the manner of taking
off a box of honey, it was objected&mdash;that, on
removing the block-front and withdrawing the
tin that opens a communication into the box
above, though a passage would thereby be
opened for the imprisoned Bees to get away,
it would at the same time afford an opening
and an opportunity&mdash;nay, be a sort of invitation
for the Bees of other hives,&mdash;for strange Bees
and robbers to get in, annoy, and destroy the
native Bees, then subdued by having been
imprisoned, and to plunder and carry away
their treasures.</p>

<p>This objection, to persons unskilled in Bee-matters,
may, I grant, appear to be plausible&mdash;nay,
reasonable: but every <i>practical apiarian</i>,
who has taken off two or three end-boxes of
honey, knows very well that there is not the
least danger to be apprehended from robbers
or marauders during the short time that the
liberated, native Bees are hurrying away as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"> 26 </a></span>
fast as they can get. I have never witnessed
any thing like an attempt to besiege and
rob a box so situated. Were, however, the
communication to be left open for any considerable
time after the Bees have departed, I
have no doubt that, if not discovered by Bees
belonging to other hives, it (the vacated box)
would be re-entered by its own Bees, and by
them be soon entirely emptied of its honey.
Nothing, however, but down-right carelessness
on the part of the operator will ever subject a
box of honey to a visitation of this description.
But, notwithstanding the conviction in <i>my</i>
mind that the above-stated objection is <i>in fact</i>
groundless, I set my wits to work to answer
it in a way more satisfactory to the highly
respectable persons who raised it, and, if by
any means I could, to obviate it entirely. It
did not cost me much mental labour to invent&mdash;<i>a
safety-block</i>,&mdash;nor does it require much
manual labour to make one.</p>

<p>A safety-block must be made to fit the place
of the common block, and may be cut out of
a piece of half-inch deal board, having one
side planed off so as to leave the bottom-edge
less than one-fourth of an inch in thickness;
then with a three-eighths-inch centre-bit cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"> 27 </a></span>
as near the lower, that is&mdash;the thin edge, as
you can, a row of holes. Ten holes in a
length of six inches will allow a convenient
space between each hole. Next, over each of
these small holes, suspend a piece of talc, cut
of a proper size for the purpose, by a thread
of silk, and make that thread fast round a
tiny brass nail above. The talc, which is a
mineral substance as transparent as glass, and
much lighter, and on that account much better
than glass, thus suspended over each hole, is
easily lifted and passed by Bees from within,
but is heavy enough to fall again as soon as a
Bee has made its exit, and forms an effectual
bar or block against the entrance of Bees from
the outside. A block of this description may
be had for a trifling expense, and is recommended
to all such inexperienced and timid&mdash;timid
because inexperienced&mdash;-apiarians, as are
apprehensive of being annoyed by intruders
when they are taking off a box of honey.
Though this safety-block rather impedes the
escape of the Bees, it has nevertheless a pretty
appearance when it is neatly made,&mdash;and it
is amusing enough to see the beautiful, little
creatures pushing open first one little trap-door
and then another, popping out their heads,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"> 28 </a></span>
and then winging their flight to the entrance
of the pavilion. After all, though it certainly
is a complete <i>safety-block</i>, and was invented to
obviate a groundless objection, it is more an
article of curiosity than of real usefulness.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have to notice the security which
the under-box or frame gives to the stability
of the three upper boxes,&mdash;the firmness with
which it supports them,&mdash;and the dry and
comfortable way in which the Bees by it are
enabled to discharge their dead, and other
superfluities of the colony, without their being
exposed to the cold atmosphere of an autumn
or a spring morning.</p>

<p>The octagon-box, marked H, is a covering
for the bell-glass, marked B, which is placed
on the middle-box, or seat of nature. It
matters not of what shape this covering is,
because any covering over the glass will
answer the same purpose, provided the under-board
of it is wide enough to cover the
divisional openings, and to throw off the wet.
I choose an octagon because of the neatness
of its appearance.</p>

<p>In endeavouring to recommend these Bee-boxes
as worthy of general adoption, in order
to succeed in my object, it is undoubtedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"> 29 </a></span>
necessary that the parts and construction of
them, and of every thing pertaining to them,
be fully explained and clearly understood: I
therefore proceed to give another view of them.</p>

<p>In the former plate they are exhibited as
open, or detached and apart from each other:
in the following one they are represented as
closed and standing together, as when stocked
with Bees, and in full operation in an apiary:
in both it is the back of the boxes that is presented.
With the exception of the alighting-board,
the front is quite plain, being without
window-shutters in the boxes, and without
drawer and block-fronts in the under-board.</p>

<p>In this plate the engraver has made the
floor-box to extend beyond the ends of the
C. C. boxes; but, as has already been observed,
and for the reason before given, it is better
that the floor-box be made so that those (C. C.)
boxes project a little over the ends and also
over the back of the floor.</p>

<p>For a Bee-passage between the pavilion and
the bell-glass, is cut, in the centre of the top
of the pavilion, a circular hole, an inch in
diameter, and from the edge of that circular
hole are cut four or six passages, just wide
enough to allow the Bees space to pass and
re-pass. These lineal cuts must of course
terminate within the circumference of the
circle formed by the edge of the bell-glass
that is placed over them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"> 32 </a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps it may be said,&mdash;in fact, it has been
said&mdash;that these boxes are in reality nothing
more than a common cottage-hive. Be it so:
but it is an <i>improved</i> cottage-hive, made
convenient by being divisible, and by having
its parts well arranged. The middle-box, or
department, marked A, is, however, square,
and not round, like the common straw-hive.
But beyond this one box the comparison
cannot easily be carried; the common straw-hive
possesses no such conveniences and
accommodations as those afforded both to
Bees and Bee-masters by the end-boxes of
my hive.</p>

<p>In the middle-box the Bees are to be first
placed: in it first they skilfully construct their
beautiful combs,&mdash;and, under the prerogative
of one sovereign&mdash;the mother of the hive&mdash;carry
on their curious works, and display their
astonishing, architectural ingenuity. In this
box the regina of the colony, surrounded by
her industrious, happy, humming subjects,
carries on the propagation of her species,&mdash;deposits
in the cells prepared for the purpose
by the other Bees, thousands upon thousands
of her eggs, though she deposits no more than
one egg in a cell at one time: these eggs are
hatched and nursed up into a numerous progeny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"> 33 </a></span>
by the other inhabitants of the hive. It is at
this time, viz. when hundreds of young Bees are
daily coming into existence, that my collateral-boxes
are of the utmost importance to the
Bees domiciled in them: for when the young
larv are perfected upon the cottage plan, a
swarm is the necessary consequence. The
Queen, with thousands of her Bee-subjects,
leaves the colony, and seeks another place in
which to carry on her astonishing labours.
But as swarming may, by proper precaution
and attention to my mode of management,
generally be prevented, it is manifestly a good
thing to do so; for the time necessarily required
to establish another colony, even supposing
the cottager succeeds in saving the swarm,
would otherwise be employed in collecting
the pure sweets, and in enriching the old hive.
Here, then, is one of the advantages of my
plan, viz. <i>the prevention of swarming</i>. When
symptoms of swarming begin to present themselves,
and which may be known by an unusual
noise in the hive or box (for it is of Bees in
boxes that I am now treating), and by the
appearance of more than common activity
among the Bees; when these symptoms are
apparent, then the Bee-master may conclude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"> 34 </a></span>
that more space is required. At this period,
therefore, he should draw out the sliding-tin,
marked 1, from under the bell-glass, which
simple operation will immediately open to the
Bees a new room&mdash;a palace&mdash;which they will
adorn, and fill with their sweets as pure as the
crystal stream. But if by mistake the manager
should draw up either of the collateral-slides,
which divide the end-boxes from the pavilion,
the Bees in that case will refuse to go up into
the glass, and will commence their works in
the collateral-box opened to them, in preference
to the elevated glass; so well aware are these
matchless insects of the inconvenience attending
the carrying of their treasures into an upper
room, when a more convenient store-house
is to be had in a lower one. The natural
movements of Bees have demonstrated to
me this fact by more than a thousand trials:
year after year I have made this experiment
to my entire satisfaction. The natural
movements of the Bees also suggested to
me the idea of the utility of ventilation, and
that by its influence their works might be
both divided and purified; and that a place
of safety might still be preserved for the
Queen in the pavilion. She wants a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"> 35 </a></span>
situation in which to carry on the work of
propagating her species. Like the fowls of
the air, she will not, if she can avoid it, propagate
her young whilst under the observation
and influence of man: she, therefore, prefers
the middle-box for her work of propagation;
as well on account of its privacy, as because
the ventilation of the end-boxes so cools their
temperature, that they are not the situation
nature requires to bring the young larv to
perfection; yet they can be kept at such a
temperature as to make them desirable store-rooms
for the Bees' treasures. By this mode
of management we prevent the necessity of
swarming; and behold the grandest chemists
in the world, and stores after stores of their
pure treasure, unadulterated by the necessary
gathering of immense quantities of farina for
the young larv, which we see in the piling
system, as well as in the common cottage-hive;
but this is all carried into the immediate
vicinity of the seat of nature, the place where
it is wanted.</p>

<p>When the glass is nearly filled, which in a
good season will be in a very short space of
time, the Bees will again want accommodation.
Previously, however, to drawing up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"> 36 </a></span>
tin-slide to enlarge their crowded house, the
manager should take off the empty end-box
he intends to open to them, and smear or dress
the inside of it with a little liquid honey.
Thus prepared, he must return the box to its
proper situation, and then withdraw the sliding-tin
between it and the pavilion, or middle-box,
and thereby enlarge the Bees' dominion, by
opening an end-box to them, which will produce
the greatest harmony in the hive. The
Bees will immediately commence their operations
in this new apartment. This simple
operation, <i>done at a proper time</i>, effectually
prevents swarming; and by it the Queen gains
a vast addition to her dominions, and consequently
additional space for the population
of her enlarged domicile. There is now no
want of store-house room, nor of employment,
for our indefatigable labourers. And while
the subjects are employed in collecting, and
manufacturing (if I may so say) their various
materials, the regina is engaged in carrying on
the great, first principle of nature&mdash;the propagation
of her species. This she does in the
department (A.) re-filling with her eggs the cells
which have been vacated by the young larv.
When, however, her next new progeny are about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"> 37 </a></span>
to be brought into life, the Bee-master must
draw out the other tin-slide, and thereby open
a communication to the other empty apartment,
and so make a further addition to the Queen's
realm; which the new, and even veteran
labourers, will presently occupy, and set about
improving and enriching their again enlarged
commonwealth. No sooner have the Bees
finished their operations in the several compartments
of their box-hive, which may be
ascertained by looking through the little windows
at the back and ends of the boxes, than
the Bee-master gently puts in the tin-slide (1.)
lifts up the lid of the octagon-box or cover (H.)
and takes off the bell-glass, filled with the purest
and most perfect honey. Before, however,
he endeavours to take away the glass, it is
necessary that he should cut through between
the bell-glass and the box, with a fine wire,
in order that the tin may the more easily slide
under the full glass of honey; when this is
done, he may take off the full glass and replace
it with an empty one. He must then
draw out the tin-slide (1.) and so on for even
The operation of taking off a glass, or a
box, of honey, may be best performed in the
middle of a fine, sunny day; and in taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"> 38 </a></span>
off a glass, the operator, having put in the
tin-slide (1.) as already directed, should wait
a few minutes, to see whether the Bees made
prisoners in the glass manifest any symptoms
of uneasiness; because, if they do not, it may
be concluded that the Queen-bee is amongst
them; and in that case it is advisable to
withdraw the slide (1.) and to re-commence
the operation another day. But if, as it
generally happens, the prisoners in the glass
should run about in confusion and restlessness,
and manifest signs of great uneasiness, <i>then</i>
the operator may conclude that all is right,
and, having taken off the octagon-cover, may
envelope the glass in a silk handkerchief, or
dark cloth, so as to exclude the light, remove
it with a steady hand, and place it on one
side, or so that the Bees may have egress from
it, in some shady place, ten or fifteen yards
from the boxes, and the Bees that were imprisoned
in it will in a few minutes effect
their escape, and return with eagerness to the
pavilion and their comrades.</p>

<p>And what may be done with B, may also
be done with either of the C. C. boxes, as
occasion requires. It may not, however, be
amiss to be more explanatory of the mode of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"> 39 </a></span>
taking away the treasures of the Bees in the
side-boxes. It will be necessary to examine
minutely the state of your boxes, particularly
when the whole of your colony is full of the
Bees' works. When the tin is put down to
divide an end-box from the mother-hive, you,
no doubt, make many prisoners; to prevent
which, the night before separating an end-box
from a middle one, lay open the ventilator,
which will not only lower the heat of the box,
but will admit the atmospheric air, which
naturally causes the Bees to leave that
apartment, and to draw themselves into the
middle-box&mdash;their native climate; when this is
done, you may put down the tin-slide (D.) as
already directed, and let your Bees remain fifteen
or twenty minutes in total darkness: then open
the windows of the box you are about to take
off, and if the Queen-bee is not within that
box, the Bees that are in it will show a great
desire to be liberated from their disagreeable
confinement, by running about in the most
hurried, agitated, and restless manner. But
should the Queen-bee be there, you will then
find the Bees show no desire to leave her;&mdash;the
commotion will appear in the middle-box.
Under such circumstances, which sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"> 40 </a></span>
happen, you must act with caution; for were
you to open the egress from the box, that is, the
block (F.) and tin-slide (2. or 4. as the case may
be) to permit their departure, very shortly would
the whole of the working Bees join their sovereign
in the box you intended to take; and this
would be a great disappointment and complete
puzzle to the Bee-master, not thoroughly
acquainted with the moves of, or proper mode
of managing, his valuable hive. To me such
an occurrence would be a repetition only of a
demonstration of facts&mdash;of pleasures unspeakable,
in beholding the grand works of nature,
the noble influence of her majesty&mdash;the Queen
of the Bees.</p>

<p>When, however, you do find the Queen in
the box you are about to take off, is it not easy
to draw the tin-slide up again? Certainly it
is easy to draw up the dividing-tin. Do so,
then, and that done, the Queen-bee will readily
embrace the opportunity of leaving the place
of her confinement; and then, having put down
the dividing-tin, you will presently be in a
situation to accomplish your object. You will
soon see the Bees running to and fro upon the
windows in the box you are about to take off,
and when you thus find them anxious to leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"> 41 </a></span>
your box of honey, close the windows, and you
have then only to open an egress by withdrawing
the tin, No. 2. or 4. as your box may
require; the Bees finding an aperture, with
light to direct their departure, will immediately
embrace the opportunity of regaining their
liberty, will fly away from their prison, and
join their fellow-labourers at the entrance of
the mother-hive. In a few minutes you will
be in possession of a box of honey, and all
your Bees will be in safety and harmonizing
with their beloved parent&mdash;the Queen of the
hive. Take from them the box your humanity
entitles you to, minding that the tin-slide is
safe to the middle-box. You will then empty
the full box, and return it empty to its former
place; then draw up your tin, and you again
enlarge their domicil, having gained a rich
reward for your operation, at the expense of
their labour. A child of twelve years of age
may be taught to do this without the least
danger; there need no Bee-dresses,&mdash;there
needs no fumigation of any sort. It is a
natural movement for the welfare of these
worthies, that prevents their swarming, and at
once secures to the sovereign Queen of Bees
her rightful throne. Reader, this declaration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"> 42 </a></span>
is founded on facts,&mdash;on the practical experience
of many years. And that you may adopt
this principle and mode of managing Honey-Bees,
that is, of taking from them their superabundance
of treasure, and preserving your
Bees uninjured, and, if you can contrive it,
improve upon the instructions here given you,
and upon the example here set you, is my
hearty wish, for my country's welfare, and for
the welfare of my admired, nay, my <i>beloved</i>
BEES.</p>

<p>Should it, however, so happen, as it sometimes
may, owing to a variety of causes, such,
for instance, as the negligence, or unskilfulness,
or unavoidable absence of the Bee-master at
a critical time, or from any other cause, should
it, I say, so happen that the pavilion, or
middle-box, should swarm, take such swarm
into one of the end-boxes, prepared for such
an event, by merely making an entrance to it,
at or as near as possible to the corner farthest
from the entrance into the middle-box; and
before this new entrance fix a small alighting
board. The swarm will thus become a family
of itself, and as much a stock pro tempore, as
if it were placed on a separate stand, provided
the dividing-tin, which separates the middle-box
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"> 43 </a></span>
from that in which the swarm is put, be
carefully adjusted, and made perfectly tight
and secure, so that a Bee cannot pass from
one box to the other. To this material point
the apiarian will necessarily attend when he
first removes the end-box in order to put the
swarm into it. In the evening place the box
containing the swarm on its floor, just where
and as it was before it was taken off. Let the
Bees thus managed work two or three weeks,
or as the nature of the season may require,&mdash;I
mean&mdash;until the end-box appears to be pretty
well filled with combs. Then close up the
exterior entrance of the collateral-box containing
the swarm of Bees, and draw out the
sliding-tin which hitherto has separated the
two families or colonies, and the Bees will
unite, and become one family. The apiarian
will likewise witness with pleasure the effect
of ventilation in the hive; for as soon as the
Bees have deposed one of the Queens, and
the end-box has been cooled by means of the
cylinder-ventilator, he will discover that the
combs will be presently emptied of every
material necessary for the support of the
young larv; so that the combs, that had
been so recently constructed for a seat of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"> 44 </a></span>
nature, soon become receptacles for pure honey,
and the numerous Bees become the subjects
of one sovereign in the middle-box.</p>

<p>This is a neat method of re-uniting a swarm
to its parent-stock; and the operation is so
easy that the most unpractised apiarian may
perform it without subjecting himself to the
slightest danger of being stung by the Bees.
It can however only be practised with Bees in
boxes. Another and a more prompt method
of returning a swarm to its parent-stock, and
which is practicable with swarms from cottage-hives,
as well as with those from boxes, is the
following.</p>

<p>After the swarm has been taken in the usual
way into an empty box, or into a straw-hive,
and suffered to settle and cluster therein for
an hour or two, gently and with a steady
hand take the box or hive, and, having a tub
of clean water placed ready and conveniently
for the purpose, with a sudden jerk dislodge
the Bees from the box or hive and immerse
them in the water. Let them remain therein
two or three minutes: then drain it off through
a sieve, or other strainer, and spread the now
harmless Bees&mdash;harmless, because apparently
half-drowned, upon a dry towel or table-cloth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"> 45 </a></span>
and search for and <i>secure the Queen</i>. This
done, and which may very easily be done,
place a board or two in a slanting direction
from the entrance of the parent-hive to the
ground; upon this lay the cloth on which are
your immersed Bees, and spread them thinly
over it, in order that they may the sooner
become dry; and, as they become dry, you
will with pleasure see them return to their
native-hive, which they will be permitted to
enter without the slightest opposition from
the Bees already therein.</p>

<p>By this operation not only are the immersed
Bees cooled, but their re-union with those
already in the hive cools them also, and considerably
lowers the temperature of the whole
stock. With a late swarm from any sort of
hive, as well as with an accidental swarm from
boxes, this is a good method to be adopted;
and, if the apiarian possess sufficient coolness
and dexterity to perform it cleverly, it is a
practice I would recommend whenever it is
advisable to return a swarm to its native-hive.
When a swarm has thus been returned to a
cottage-hive an eke should be added forthwith.</p>

<p>Before I further explain the nature of my
collateral Bee-boxes, I shall briefly express my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"> 46 </a></span>
desire that my readers will attend particularly
to the discovery of the effects of ventilation.
I have been asked&mdash;"Of what use is ventilation
in the domicil of Bees?" I answer&mdash;one
of its uses has already been described,
and much more of its use, I may say, of its
necessity, in the humane management of Bees
will be told presently. Many treatises on the
management of these valuable insects have
appeared, but in none of them do I find any
allusion to this important point&mdash;important in
my practice at least, and essentially necessary
in it. Therefore&mdash;</p>

<p>Perhaps the divided labour of the Honey-Bees
was anticipated by the author of these
lines: but, be that as it might, I, in my turn,
will ask&mdash;How can we preserve the Bees
uninjured, divide their works, and take away
their superabundant treasure, without the influence
of ventilation? I think it is impossible.
A lesson, a true lesson from nature, has demonstrated
this fact to me, and twelve years'
constant labour and attention to this important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"> 47 </a></span>
subject have put into operation my plans for
the welfare of that wonderful insect&mdash;the
sovereign Queen of Bees. Well might Dr.
Bevan say&mdash;</p>

<div class="center2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">First of the throng, and foremost of the whole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One stands confess'd the sovereign and the soul.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Curious facts respecting this extraordinary
creature are before me, which have been
ascertained and proved by means of my observatory-hive.
This hive is unknown in any
work hitherto published on the interesting
subject of Bee-management: and with reference
to it I may observe&mdash;that when a new
principle is discovered by studying nature,
such principle will seldom fail to produce
effects beneficial in proportion to its being
understood and skilfully applied. So simple
and so rational (if I may so say) is my observatory-hive,
that it cannot but be approved,
when it is once understood, by the followers of
my apiarian practice. Be my humble theory
what it may, it hath truth for its foundation;
and by perseverance and industry I flatter
myself I shall materially improve, if not bring
to perfection, the cultivation and management
of Honey-Bees, merely by pointing out <i>how</i>
the produce of their labour may be divided,
<i>how</i> a part thereof may be taken away, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"> 48 </a></span>
sufficiency be left for the sustenance of the
stock, and <i>how</i> their lives may be preserved
notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Much has been said against the probable
results of this practice: but facts are stubborn
things; and luckily for me and my mode of
Bee-management, I have an abundance of the
most incontrovertible facts to adduce, which
will, I think and hope, convince all those who
have heretofore entertained doubts upon the
subject.</p>

<p>The first movement in my apiarian practice
commences with the pavilion of nature. This
pavilion, which is equivalent to a cottage-hive,
is the subject of my present observations and
explanation.</p>

<p>I say, then,&mdash;-disturb not this hive&mdash;this
pavilion of nature: weaken not its population;
but support its influence, and extend to it those
accommodations which no practice, except my
own, has yet put into operation, or made any
adequate provision for. This humane practice
partakes not of the driving, nor of the fumigating,
nor of the robbing system. It is a
liberal principle of Bee-cultivation founded on
humanity. And it is by such practice that
we must succeed, if we hope to be benefited
by the culture of Honey-Bees.</p>

<p class="caption3">VENTILATION.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">To</span> ascertain the degree of heat in a colony of
Bees, and to regulate it by means of ventilation,
as circumstances may require, recourse
must be had to the use of the thermometer,
as will be explained presently. But here I
would ask my worthy Bee-keepers, whether,
in the course of their experience, they have at
any time beheld a honey-comb suspended
beneath the pedestal of any of their hives&mdash;a
circumstance that not unfrequently occurs
under old stools? The beautiful appearance
of a comb suspended in such a situation is, as
it were, the very finger of Providence, pointing
out the effects of ventilation, and teaching us
by an example the necessity there is for it in a
crowded, busy hive. Behold the purity of
such a comb; examine the cause of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"> 50 </a></span>
purity, and you will find that it is owing&mdash;solely
and undoubtedly owing&mdash;to the powerful
influence of VENTILATION.</p>

<p>An occurrence of this description, I mean&mdash;the
discovery of a beautiful comb suspended,
as just described, having excited my curiosity
and my admiration, led me to inquire into the
cause of it, and to study to discover, if by
any means I could, why my skilful, little
Bees should have constructed their combs in
such a situation. My observations soon satisfied
me that one of these two causes, viz.
either a want of room in the hive,&mdash;or a
disagreeable and oppressive heat in it,&mdash;or
most probably, a combination of these two
causes, had rendered it necessary for them, if
they continued working at all, to carry on
their work in that singular manner. My next
step was to endeavour to prove the truth of
my reasonings and conclusions, in which, I
flatter myself, I have fully succeeded, after no
inconsiderable labour, and many contrivances
to accommodate the Bees with additional
room, as they have had occasion for it, and
after repeated experiments to keep such room,
when added, at a temperature agreeable to
them by means of ventilation. In short, my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"> 51 </a></span>
COLLATERAL-BOXES and VENTILATION
are the results of my studies and
experiments on this point of apiarian science.</p>

<p>There are few persons, who are managers of
Honey-Bees under the old hive system, who,
if they have not seen a comb constructed and
suspended in the manner just described, have
not, however, beheld these little creatures,
when oppressed with the internal heat of their
crowded domicil, and straitened for want of
room in it, unhappily clustering and hanging
at the door, or from and under the floor-board
of their hive, in a ball frequently as large as
a man's head, and sometimes covering all the
front part of it, for sixteen or twenty days
together; and this, be it remarked, at the
season of the year which is the most profitable
for their labours in the fields and among the
flowers. During this distress of the Bees in,
or belonging to, such a hive, their labours are
of necessity suspended,&mdash;their gathering of
honey ceases,&mdash;ceases too at the very time that
that saccharine substance is most plentifully
secreted by the vegetable world. And&mdash;-why?
Because they want an enlargement of their
domicil,&mdash;an extension of the dominion, or
(if it may be so termed) of the territory of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"> 52 </a></span>
Queen; by which enlargement swarming is
superseded, and the Royal Insect relieved
from the necessity of abdicating her throne,
retains it, continues and extends the propagation
of her species, and of course increases
the busy labours of her innumerable subjects.
<i>This accommodation is provided for Bees in my
collateral-boxes.</i></p>

<p>Ancient as well as modern Bee-keepers
have frequently adopted the plan of eking,
that is&mdash;placing three or four rounds of a
straw-hive (called an eke) under their hives.
This method of enlarging a hive does in many
instances prevent swarming during that one
season. Notwithstanding, from all that I can
see in it, it tends only to put off the evil day,
and to accumulate greater numbers of Bees
for destruction the following year. This is
certain, because on minute examination of the
pavilion of nature, we find an increase of
wealth, as well as an increase of numbers in
the state; but there is no provision or contrivance
in the common hive for dividing the
wealthy produce of the labours of those
numbers: eking will not do it,&mdash;eking enlarges
the hive, and that is all it does; consequently to
get at their honey, the necessity for destroying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"> 53 </a></span>
the Bees follows, and the suffocating fumes
of brimstone at length bring these worthies to
the ground&mdash;to the deadly pit in which they
are first suffocated, then buried, and are, alas,
no more! a few minutes close the existence of
thousands that had laboured for their ungrateful
masters; and their once happy domicil
becomes a scene of murder, of plunder, and of
devastation, which is a disgrace to Bee-masters,
and ought by all means to be discountenanced
and discontinued. Assuredly Bees are given
to us by the gracious Giver of all good things
for a better purpose than that of being destroyed
by thousands and by millions. Are we not
instructed by the sacred writings to go to the
Bee and to the ant, and learn wisdom? We
are not told, neither are we warranted, by this
language, to go and destroy them and their
works,&mdash;-to disobey the commands of their, no
less than of our Maker, who has given Bees
to us for our edification and comfort, and not
wantonly to commit a species of murder, in
order to procure their delicious treasure. Nor
is there the slightest necessity for destroying
Bees in this cruel manner, when an act of
humanity will obtain for us their purest honey,
and secure to us their lives for future and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"> 54 </a></span>
profitable labour. Surely, then, an act of
humanity to Bees cannot be displeasing to
any one, especially when we are taught by
the beneficial results of our experience, that
their lives <i>may be preserved</i>, and their labours
for us thereby continued.</p>

<p>Apiarian reader, take this subject into thy
serious consideration: in the busy hive behold
the curious works of God's creatures&mdash;the
Bees; misuse riot, then, the works of his hands;
but improve upon this lesson from nature:
and for a moment pause before thou lightest
the deadly match,&mdash;before thou appliest it
with murderous intent to the congregated
thousands in thy hive.</p>

<div class="center2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It's he who feels no rev'rence for God's sacred name,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Taking the dreadful match, I see a murderer stand.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>These insects' indefatigable labours alone
should humanize our feelings for them, and
induce us to spare their lives, for the rich
treasures which they first collect, and then
unresistingly yield up to us when operated
upon by the healthy influence of ventilation.</p>

<p>Why should we lay the axe to the root of
the tree that produces such good fruit? Rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"> 55 </a></span>
let us gather from its pure branches, and let
the root live. Examine the nature and effects
of my Bee-machinery, and you will discover
its utility and its value in the management
of Bees. By the proper application of that
machinery you may instantaneously divide the
treasures of the Bees, even in the most vigorous
part of their gathering season, without the
least danger to the operator, and frequently
without the destruction of a single Bee. Is
not this, then, a rational and humane practice?
I trust it wants only to be properly understood
in order to be universally adopted.</p>

<p>Again: Does not she that is a kind mother
know the wants and desires of her children?
Take the lovely offspring from its mother's
care and protection, and imprison it before
her eyes, and will she not impatiently cry
aloud for its release and restoration to liberty?
and will not the child's screams show its
affection for its fond parent? and when its
liberty is restored, does not consolation quickly
follow? The lost child being once more under
its mother's care, both mother and child are
happy. Similar facts are exemplified by the
mother of the hive, who loves her multitudinous
offspring, and lives in harmony and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"> 56 </a></span>
affection with them. She evidently dislikes
a separation from her subjects, who seem to be,
and doubtless are, most devotedly attached to
her. And when, on taking off a glass or a box,
they are divided only for a few minutes, we
witness their sorrow, and hear their lamentations
in the hive,&mdash;the Queen-mother calling
for her children, anxious on their part to be
released; and as soon as an opportunity is
afforded them of effecting their escape, they
embrace it,&mdash;the moment they feel their
liberty, they gladly take advantage of it, and
return to the pavilion in multitudes, so that
in a short time tranquillity is restored, and
peace and happiness are again enjoyed by the
previously unhappy mother of the hive,&mdash;her
subjects crowd round her, and the place that
had lately been their prison soon becomes their
palace, and a magazine for future treasure,
which the humane apiarian will again be
entitled to.</p>

<p>Much has been said on the piling or storifying
mode of managing Bees; and I admit
that there are advantages in it which we do
not meet with in the cottage-hive system. It
is, notwithstanding, imperfect in the design,&mdash;it
is founded in error,&mdash;in practice it is liable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"> 57 </a></span>
to many difficulties,&mdash;and it is particularly
disadvantageous to the labours of these valuable
insects, as will be more fully shown when I
come to state my objections to it.</p>

<p>We have only to study the nature and habits
of Bees, and to watch particularly the desires
of these indefatigable creatures. They alone
will teach us the lesson. But follow them
through their movements during a summer's
day, and you will behold them, as it were,
pitifully asking for the assistance of man, according

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">As</span> I have been frequently asked to explain
the utility of ventilation in a hive or colony
of Bees, so have I as frequently been asked,
sometimes with civility and politeness, sometimes
jeeringly and in contempt,&mdash;"What has
the thermometer to do with Bees?" I answer&mdash;We
shall see presently; and I trust, see
enough to convince the veriest sceptic on the
subject, that the thermometer is an instrument
that is indispensably necessary in the management
of Bees according to my plan. Such
inquirers might as reasonably ask what the
mainspring of a watch has to do with the
movements of that machine? Without the
mainspring the watch would not work at all;
and without the thermometer we cannot ascertain
with any degree of accuracy the interior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"> 59 </a></span>
temperature of the hive; the knowledge of which
temperature is of the utmost consequence in
the humane management of Honey-Bees. The
thermometer is the safest, if not the sole guide
to a scientific knowledge of their state and
works. To ventilate an apiary or colony of
Bees, when their interior temperature is under
60 degrees, would be ruinous to them,&mdash;because
contrary to the prosperous progress of
their natural labours. From upwards of fifteen
hundred observations in the summer of 1825,
I am fully satisfied on this point. Their nature
is to keep up at least that, and sometimes a
much higher, degree of temperature by their
indefatigable labours; and as the temperature
of the hive rises, so does it invigorate and encourage
an increase of population, as well as an
increase of their treasured sweets. As the hive
fills, so will the thermometer rise to 120 and
even to 130 degrees, before these worthies will
by over-heat be forced to leave their wealthy
home. When the thermometer is at the
above height, these wealthy colonists will have
arrived at the highest state of perfection,&mdash;wealthy
indeed, every store-house being filled
nearly to suffocation with their abundant treasures,
and they, as it were, petitioning the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"> 60 </a></span>
observer of their too-limited store-house for a
fresh room. Thus circumstanced then give
them a fresh room,&mdash;accommodate them with
such a store-house as either of my collateral-boxes
will and is intended to afford them.
<i>Force them not to warm:</i> an emigration from
a prosperous colony of half its population cannot
fail of being very disadvantageous, both
to those that emigrate, who must necessarily
be poor, and to those that remain, be they
ever so industrious, or ever so wealthy.</p>

<p>When you discover your thermometer rising
rapidly, and, instead of standing, as it generally
does in a well-stocked colony, at about
80 degrees, rising in a few hours to 90, and
perhaps to 96, or even to 100, you may conclude
that ventilation is <i>then</i> highly necessary.
The more you ventilate, when their temperature
gets to this oppressive and dangerous
height, the more you benefit the Bees labouring
under it; for when they find a comfortable
temperature within, they enjoy it, and will
proceed to fill every vacant comb.</p>

<p>Nature has provided the Queen of Bees
with the power of multiplying her species,
and of providing against any casualty which
in so numerous a state may frequently happen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"> 61 </a></span>
That all-seeing eye that neither slumbers nor
sleeps, but constantly superintends alike the
affairs of insects and of men, has, doubtless,
long beheld the shameful neglect of man,
which is the main cause of the distress of the
hive, and which <i>forces</i> it to swarm. Let man,
then, remedy the distress and mischief which
he occasions, by <i>preventing it</i>. It is the
Queen-Bee that emigrates; were she not to
lead, none would lead; nor would any follow
were another than the Queen to lead, to seek
and to settle in some place more congenial
to them than an over-heated, over-stocked,
though rich hive. She well knows she cannot
live in a state subjected to a suffocating heat,
amidst an overgrown population. So she
leaves the royal cradle, impregnated with the
royal larva, and withdraws from the hive,
reluctantly, one may suppose, though accompanied
by thousands of her subjects. The
Queen-Bee leads the swarm to seek a place of
comfort, and to establish another home, where
not one cell nor drop of honey exists.</p>

<p>To establish the truth of these assertions,
and to prove the utility of ventilation and of
the thermometer, in regulating the degree of
ventilation in the management of Bees, I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"> 62 </a></span>
now give my reader an account of some interesting
experiments that I made in 1826, and
then add a few extracts from my thermometrical
journal of that summer; which in fact guided
me in those experiments, for without the assistance
of my thermometer I could not have made
them; from which, taken together, it will, I
think, be sufficiently evident that ventilation
and the thermometer are highly necessary,&mdash;are
alike important,&mdash;in short, are <i>indispensable</i>
in the humane management of Honey-bees.</p>

<p>On the 26th of June 1826, I suffered a colony
of Bees to swarm, in order to prove the truth of
the foregoing statements. It was a very fine
colony: the thermometer had been standing
at 110 for six days previously, in one of the
collateral end-boxes; on the eighth day it
rose suddenly to 120. I was then forcing
my Bees to leave their home; I could have
lowered their temperature, and by so doing, I
could have retained my worthies in their
native boxes: but I was then about to prove
a fact of the greatest moment to apiarians.
On the ninth day, at half-past twelve o'clock,
the finest swarm I ever beheld towered above
my head, and literally darkened the atmosphere
in the front of my apiary. After remaining about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"> 63 </a></span>
five minutes in the open air, the Queen perched
herself upon a tree in my garden, where she
was exposed to the rays of a scorching sun;
but her loyal subjects quickly surrounded her,
and screened her from its influence. I immediately
did what I could to assist my grand
prize, by hanging a sheet before it, to ward
off the intense heat of the sun. I allowed
the Bees to hang in this situation until the
evening. During the absence of the swarm
from the colony, my full employment was to
watch the parent-stock, in order that I might,
in the evening, return the Bees of this beautiful
swarm to their native-hive, which they
had been forced to leave. Curiosity and a
desire to solve a doubtful problem, for the good
of future apiarians, led me to act as already
related, at the expense of much inconvenience
to the Bees. The remaining Honey-Bees
continued labouring during the remainder of
the day; and in the evening of that same day,
the thermometer was standing at 90 degrees
in the old stock; so that the absence of the
swarm had lowered the temperature of the
pavilion 30 degrees, and I was quite sure I
could reduce it in the collateral end-box to
that of the exterior atmosphere, which, after
the sun had gone down, was only 65.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"> 64 </a></span></p>

<p>To effect this, I resolved at once to take off
a fine top-glass filled with honey. I did so:
its weight was fourteen pounds. This operation
reduced the interior heat of the colony
to 75. But looking at my grand swarm, and
intent as I was upon re-uniting it to the
parent-stock, I thought it impossible for the
vacant space conveniently to hold all the Bees.
I had one, and only one, alternative left,&mdash;and
that was to take from my colony a collateral-box.
I therefore took it; and a most beautiful
box it was: its weight was fifty pounds. I
immediately placed an empty box in the
situation the full one had occupied. I then
drew from the side of the pavilion the dividing
tin-slide, and the whole of the colony was
shortly at the desired temperature of 65, that
being the exterior heat of the evening. I
was now fully convinced of the propriety of
returning the swarm. I commenced operations
for accomplishing that object at ten o'clock
in the evening, by constructing a temporary
stage near the mouth of the parent-stock. I
then procured a white sheet, and laid it upon
the table or temporary stage, and in a moment
struck the swarm from the hive into which the
Bees had been taken from the bough in the
evening. My next difficulty was to imprison
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"> 65 </a></span>
the sovereign of the swarm: but with a little
labour I succeeded in discovering her, and
made her my captive. No sooner was she
my prisoner than the Bees seemed to be
acquainted with her absence. But so near
were they placed to the mouth of the parent-stock
that they soon caught the odour of the
hive, and in the space of about fifteen minutes
the whole swarm, save only her majesty, were
under the roof of their parent-home. The
following morning increased my anxiety about
the welfare of my stock. Fearful lest my
carious anticipations should meet with a disappointment,
at sun-rise in the morning I
released from her imprisonment the captive
Queen. I placed her on the front-board, near
the entrance of her hive, to ascertain, if possible,
whether there was within the state one
greater than herself. But no visible sign of
such being the case presented itself. The
influence of the cheery sun soon caused her
to move her majestic body to the entrance of
her native domicil, where she was met, surrounded,
and no doubt welcomed, by thousands
of her subjects, who soon conducted her into
the hive, and, it may be presumed, re-instated
her on the throne, which a few hours before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"> 66 </a></span>
she had been compelled to abdicate. The
Bees afterwards sallied forthwith extraordinary
alacrity and regularity, and, beyond my most
sanguine expectations, filled a large glass with
honey in the short space of six days. That
glass of honey was exhibited at the National
Repository, with a model of my apiary, and
was much admired by many of the members
and visitors of that noble institution.</p>

<p>I have now to remark, that during the nine
days after the swarm had been returned to
the parent-stock, the thermometer continued
rising until it reached the temperature of 90
within the collateral-box; and on the tenth
day, at five o'clock in the morning, I witnessed
the grand secret,&mdash;I viewed with unutterable
delight the extraordinary fact I had been
endeavouring to ascertain,&mdash;viz.&mdash;<i>two royal
nymphs laid prostrate on the alighting-board</i>,
near the exterior entrance of the hive. This
circumstance alone convinced me that no more
swarming was necessary. I have further to
notice, that on the third day afterwards the
Bees commenced their destruction of the
drones,&mdash;which was a satisfactory proof that
I had gained my point. That colony has
never swarmed since the period I thus first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"> 67 </a></span>
satisfactorily established the utility of ventilation.
And on minutely attending to the
extraordinary movements of this my favourite
colony, it was not uncommon to notice the
most infant appearance of the royal brood
lying upon the front-board of the pavilion.
So that I am well satisfied that the royal larva
is always in existence in the hive, independently
of the reigning Queen. Let me not be misunderstood;
I do not mean by this expression
to assert&mdash;that the royal larva exists in the
hive without the instrumentality or agency of
the reigning Queen;&mdash;far from it; for no common
Bees can make a sovereign Bee without
the egg from the royal body: what I do mean
is&mdash;that the royal larva is always in existence
in a colony of Bees, notwithstanding the
existence and presence of a reigning Queen&mdash;that
the Queen is there, and that the royal
larva is there at the same time. In this the
wisdom of Providence is manifest; for Nature
has <i>thus</i> provided that the royal cradle should
contain the royal brood, that in case any
accident, misfortune, casualty, or necessity,
should occasion the absence of the reigning
Queen, another may be brought forth. This
larva in reserve, as it were, is protected and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"> 68 </a></span>
reared by the inhabitants with the utmost
care, nay, in the absence of the Queen, it is
almost worshipped, until it becomes sufficiently
matured to take the office and fulfil the duties
of its royal predecessor; of course it then reigns
supreme,&mdash;it is then Queen absolute. On
this point I not only coincide in opinion with
Thorley, but have seen enough in the course
of my experience among Bees to confirm the
truth of what I have now stated. As, however,
the further discussion of this nice point belongs
to the natural history of the Bee rather than
to the explanation and inculcation of my
practical mode of Bee-management, I refrain
from saying more upon it, lest by so doing I
should inadvertently excite criticism and controversy.
I therefore proceed with my proper
subject.</p>

<p>The following thermometrical observations
are from the journal before mentioned. The
first column gives the day of the month,&mdash;the
second shows the hour of the day when the
thermometer was examined,&mdash;and the third is
its height at those several times in the colony
of Bees upon which my experiments were so
successfully made.</p>

<p>At this state of the Thermometer
it is highly necessary
to remove your Bees to their
summer stand. A great decrease
of wealth in the hive will appear
daily under this temperature;
and feeding should be resorted
to until it rise to 50: and if
<i>moderate feeding</i> be continued
until the interior temperature
reach 55, it will materially
strengthen and invigorate your
Bees. And as the thermometer
continues to rise, you will find
your hive improve. It will soon
be in a good state for the spring.
Considerable improvements in
the combs, and immense gathering
of farina, appear to occupy
the Bees at this time.</p>

<p>The enemies of Bees are
numerous and active in this
month. As much as possible
guard against their attacks, and
be careful to defend your Bees
against them. At all times keep
their floor-boards clean; and
now withdraw the dead Bees, if
there should appear to be any
lying on the floor-boards or
other stands. This will save
the live Bees much labour, and
may be done very easily.</p>

<p>Did I deem it necessary, I could, from the
letters of a variety of highly respectable correspondents,
show that the mode of managing
Bees in the way, and upon the principles,
now explained, has been adopted, and <i>has
succeeded</i> even beyond the most sanguine
expectations of many of my worthy friends
and patrons; but I will content myself at
present with giving the two following letters,
which I have just received from a gentleman
in this neighbourhood, whose very name, to
all who have any knowledge of or acquaintance
with him, will be a sufficient guarantee that
his statements are facts. Besides, his letters
are a condensed, and I must say&mdash;clever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"> 76 </a></span>
epitome of my practical directions for the
management of Bees in my boxes, and may
be useful on that account; and moreover, I
have, as will be seen presently, his unsolicited
authority to make them public, and therefore
run no risk of being called to order for so
doing.</p>

<p class="tdr">"Gedney-Hill, 13th July, 1832.</p>

<p>"Dear Sir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"You</span> will, I am persuaded, excuse
me for troubling you with the information that
I yesterday took off a fine glass of honey
from one of my Bee-colonies. I went to
work secundum artem, that is, in one word,
<i>scientifically</i>, or in four words, <i>according to
your directions</i>; and I have the satisfaction,
nay more,&mdash;I have the pleasure to add that I
succeeded&mdash;I had almost said <i>completely</i>, but
I must qualify that expression by saying, that
<i>I succeeded all but completely</i>; for one luckless
Bee had the misfortune to be caught between
the edges of the dividing-tin and the glass,
and to be crushed to death in consequence.
Excepting that accident, I believe that not
one Bee was injured, nor lost. They left the
glass, as soon as I gave them the opportunity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"> 77 </a></span>
of leaving it, in the most peaceable manner;
in a subdued and plaintive tone they hummed
round me,&mdash;settled upon me,&mdash;crept over me
in all directions,&mdash;but not one of them stung
me; in short, they returned to their home
without manifesting the slightest symptoms
of resentment, and in less than half an hour
from the commencement of the operation,
<i>there was not a single Bee left in the glass</i>.
In my eye it is a very handsome glass of
honey; it weighs exactly 13 lbs, and it has
not one brood-cell in it. I intend to close it
up,&mdash;to label it,&mdash;and to keep it, at least
until I get another as handsome. It is a <i>rich</i>
curiosity to exhibit to one's friends, especially
to those who have never seen such a thing.</p>

<p>"On the other side, I send you a fortnight's
register of the heights and variations of a
thermometer, placed in the colony from which
I have taken the glass, and also, of one placed
in the shade, and apart from all Bees; from
which register you will know, in a moment,
whether I have managed my Bees properly.
I am willing to flatter myself that I have,
and that you will say I have been very
attentive indeed.</p>

and when it was otherwise, on what days the
Bees were able to get abroad, and also when
they were kept at home by rain, or by any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"> 79 </a></span>
other cause. From these observations of the
wind and weather, and particularly from the
manner in which the wind is directed towards,
or into the ventilators in the boxes, in conjunction
with the movements of the Bees, I
think I can account pretty satisfactorily for
what may appear, at first sight, to be a little
contradictory, viz. for the rising of the thermometer
in the boxes sometimes when it was
falling in the shade; and vice versa, for its
sometimes rising in the shade when it was
falling in the boxes. But instead of writing
you a dissertation on these subjects, or on
any of them, I choose rather to put you into
possession of the whole of my Bee-practice,
by submitting to your notice a copy, or as
nearly as I can make it a copy, of a letter I
took the liberty of addressing to the Editor of
'The Voice of Humanity,' in October last, after
the appearance in No. V. of that publication,
of a representation and <i>imperfect</i> explanation
of your boxes. I was encouraged to write
that letter by the following announcement in
an article in that No.&mdash;'A due regard of
rational humanity towards the Bee, though
but an insect, we shall feel a pleasure in
promoting in the future as well as the present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"> 80 </a></span>
pages of our publication. This subject has,
moreover, a very strong claim, inasmuch as it
also exemplifies the grand principle upon
which The Voice of Humanity is founded&mdash;the
true <i>prevention of cruelty</i> to animals, by
substituting a practical, an <i>improved system</i>,
in the place of one which is defective; this,
in reference to the present subject, &amp;c., <i>is true
prevention of cruelty</i>, not only to units, but
to thousands and tens of thousands of animals.'
Notwithstanding this very <i>rational</i>
announcement, and the prompt acknowledgment
of the receipt of my letter, it did not
appear in either of the next two numbers, nor
am I aware that it is in the last, but I have
not yet seen the last No. of that publication,
therefore must not be positive. But this is
not all: in No. 6, the conductors of that
work express i sincere pleasure' in inserting an
article which, they say, c forms an admirable
addition to that on Mr. Nutt's Bee-hive;' and
that 'the plan which it developes, in addition
to its humanity, has the recommendation of
being more simple and practicable than even
the excellent improvements of Mr. Nutt.' Now
what do you suppose this <i>admirable</i> addition
to your Bee-hive,&mdash;-this plan recommended on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"> 81 </a></span>
account of its <i>humanity</i>, as well as on other
accounts&mdash;is? It is no other than that most
cruel and destructive one of depriving Bees
of their honey <i>and of every thing else</i>, by
'driving them out of a full hive into an empty
one, so early in the season as to afford the
Bees sufficient time to provide themselves with
another stock of winter food before the bad
weather begins.' Very considerate this, certainly!
but who can tell how soon the bad
weather may begin? Of all the methods
ever resorted to of getting their honey from
Bees, this, in my humble opinion, is the most
cruel and <i>inhuman</i>: suffocating the Bees and
destroying them at once is far preferable to
this (I had hoped) exploded mode of robbing
them. If practised, it will, however, soon
cure itself: but is it not a strange practice for
'The Voice of Humanity' to revive? Either
the utterers of that sweet Voice are unacquainted
with the humane management of
Bees upon your plan, or they are unaware of
the mischievous and destructive consequences
attendant on the driving mode of deprivation,
or they have little claim to the title they bear
on the score of their humanity to Bees. I
believe the former to be the case with them:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"> 82 </a></span>
and therefore, in addition to the reason already
given for troubling you herewith, and in order
to set them right on this <i>vital</i> subject, I give
you full power to do what you please with
these letters. If they will be of any use to
you in your projected publication, give them
a place in it, and welcome: only do not garble
them, <i>give them entire, if you give them at all</i>.
I am decidedly opposed to the driving scheme;
and I as decidedly approve of yours, which
is, if properly attended to, at once simple,
practicable, profitable, admirable, and truly
humane.</p>

<p>"Mr. Editor,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Since</span> the publication of the
last No. of 'The Voice of Humanity,' in
which you treated your readers with some
interesting particulars explanatory of the
construction and different parts of Mr. Nutt's
Bee-boxes, and also of the mode of managing
the Bees in them, so far at least as regards
the taking away a box when stored with the
delicious sweet (i. e. with honey), it has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"> 83 </a></span>
suggested to me, that a plain, simple history
of a colony of Bees in my possession, and
managed according to Mr. Nutt's excellent
plan, may not be altogether unacceptable to
the general readers and friends of 'The Voice
of Humanity' and may be even <i>a treat</i> to
amateur apiarians, who may be unacquainted
with the merits of Mr. Nutt's plan; or who,
if partially acquainted therewith, may have
their doubts as to its practicability, or, at
least, as to its advantages, i. e. superiority
over other plans. As far, then, as 6 The
Voice of Humanity' can make them (the
merits of Mr. Nutt's plan) known, I trust it
will be as music to that Voice to publish the
following facts.</p>

<p>"Having had a complete set of Mr. Nutt's
boxes presented to me, I, though comparatively
a novice in apiarian science, and not at that
time particularly attached to it, could not,
in compliment to the donor, do less than
endeavour to work them, that was&mdash;get them
stocked. That was done with a swarm on
the 18th of May 1830; and the middle-box,
or pavilion of nature, as Mr. Nutt calls it,
into which the said swarm was taken just in
the same way it would have been if put into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"> 84 </a></span>
common straw-hive, was conveyed a distance
of nearly four miles and placed in my garden
in the evening of the same day. The next day
being fine, I observed that the Bees were very
busy constructing comb, and had, within
twenty-four hours of their being domiciled in
their new abode, actually made a progress in
that most curious work that astonished me:
they were passing and re-passing, and literally
all alive; many were visibly loaded with materials
for their ingenious work. My curiosity
was excited, and so much was I pleased with
my multitudinous labourers that I visited them
daily, and many times in the course of each
day, when the weather was favourable for their
getting abroad. Their combs were rapidly
advanced; but to my great mortification they
very soon obstructed my view of their interior
works, by bringing a fine comb quite over the
only little window at the back of the pavilion,
at the distance of about half an inch from the
glass. I was not, however, without the means
of ascertaining that they were filling the pavilion
with their treasures, and consequently
that they would soon be in want of more room.
I, therefore, at the end of a fortnight admitted
them into the large bell-glass by withdrawing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"> 85 </a></span>
the slide, which, when closed, cuts oft' the
communication between the pavilion and the
said glass. They (the Bees) immediately reconnoitred
it, as it were, and examined it round
and round, and presently took possession of it
in great numbers; and in the course of the
second day afterwards I could perceive that
they began to continue their work upwards
from and upon the combs in the box. Here
I was again inexpressibly gratified by daily
observing the progress of their beautiful work,
and by the busy thousands in perpetual motion.
When they had about half-filled the glass,
and before I was aware that there was any
occasion for their admission into either of the
collateral-boxes, they suddenly threw off a
swarm. That event I attribute partly to my own
inexperience in apiarian matters, and partly&mdash;principally
to the want of a thermometer by
which to ascertain and regulate the temperature
of the crowded pavilion, so as to keep the Bees
<i>at the working, and below the swarming point
of heat</i>. Mr. Nutt assures me that a barn
would not contain a colony of Bees if its
temperature were raised above a certain
degree. What that precise degree of heat is I
leave to Mr. Nutt to determine and explain:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"> 86 </a></span>
at present it is enough to state that I am
convinced it is possible, nay, quite easy, to
keep Bees at work, and to prevent their
swarming, by giving them plenty of room, and
by proper ventilation. After my Bees had
thrown off the swarm, as above mentioned,
the work in the glass progressed but slowly,
indeed it was for some time almost deserted,
owing, I presume, to the room made in the
pavilion by the absence of the thousands that
had left it: for, whenever the weather was
such that they could get abroad, they were
always busy. The season, however, it is well-known,
was so wet as to be very unfavourable
for Bees:&mdash;the summer of 1830 was not by
any means what is called a Bee-year; and
early in the autumn I could see that, instead
of adding to their store, they were under the
necessity of living upon it. They were, however,
abundantly provided for the winter, and
lived through it almost to a Bee. In the
spring of this year (1831) they appeared to be
strong and in excellent condition. As early
as the middle of May they had replenished
the emptied combs in the glass, and, it may
be presumed, in the pavilion too. In the first
week of June, the glass was completely filled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"> 87 </a></span>
in the most beautiful manner. I therefore
opened the communication to one of the end
or collateral-boxes, and two or three days
afterwards, viz. on the 10th of June, I took off
the glass and replaced it with another. So
rapidly did those industrious little insects
proceed with their work, that in about six
weeks they completely filled the end-box. I
then opened the way to the empty box at the
other end of the pavilion: and a few days
afterwards had the full box taken off by
Mr. Nutt himself (who happened to call upon
me, and who handsomely volunteered his
services on the occasion), without any stifling
of any sort&mdash;without the destruction, or the
loss, of&mdash;scarcely a Bee,&mdash;as nearly in the
manner described in your last No. as circumstances
would permit; for the Queen-Bee
being in the box taken off made it necessary
for Mr. Nutt to vary the operation a little;&mdash;not
a person was stung, though ladies, very
timid ladies, and children too, were among the
admiring lookers on; only, in returning the
Queen-Bee, found in the box, to the pavilion,
I myself was stung, owing to my over-anxiety
to see how she would be received by the
Bees in the pavilion. Her majesty's presence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"> 88 </a></span>
in that box (the box taken off) at that time
might probably have puzzled me; but to Mr.
Nutt it presented no difficulty; and to witness
his operation was to me a most instructive
lesson, and would have delighted any friend
of humanity. It was performed in the
middle of a fine day. That box contained,
as nearly as we could estimate, about 35 lbs.
of honey, incomparably purer and finer than
any I ever saw, except from Mr. Nutt's boxes.
The glass beforementioned contained 12 lbs.&mdash;so
that I have this year taken <i>forty-seven
pounds</i> of the very finest honey from one stock
of Bees;&mdash;I have all my Bees alive&mdash;and they
are at this time abundantly provided for the
ensuing winter; nay, without impoverishing
them, I believe, I might take 6 or 8 lbs. more;
but I have already had enough; and, if my
Bees have more than enough for their winter's
consumption, they will not waste it;&mdash;it will
be found next year.</p>

<p>"The preservation of the Bees unhurt, uninjured,
very many of them undisturbed at all,&mdash;the
quantity of honey that may be had,&mdash;and
the very superior quality of that honey, are
advantages of Mr. Nutt's mode of Bee-management,
over the barbarous, stifling system,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"> 89 </a></span>
that cannot fail to recommend it to the
adoption of every friend of humanity,&mdash;to
every lover of the delicious sweet,&mdash;and to
every apiarian who has nothing beyond self-interest
in view.</p>

<p>"One word more, and I have done. There
are, I observe with pleasure, persons of considerable
influence among your subscribers, and
probably there may be persons of still greater
influence among your readers. To such I
would most respectfully suggest the propriety
of doing something to reward Mr. Nutt for
the services he has already rendered the
Honey-Bee and the cause of humanity. I&mdash;an
obscure, country clergyman, know not how
to set about procuring it; but a <i>premium was
never more richly deserved</i>.</p>

sat down to write, I hope you will find no
difficulty in giving the foregoing communication
a place in your pages; and, in this hope,

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">ON DRIVING BEES.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">As</span> my reverend correspondent has introduced
the subject of <i>driving</i> Bees from their full hive
into an empty one, in order that they may be
deprived of their honey and wax, and has
animadverted upon that practice with some
severity, I will take the opportunity of here
stating my objections to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Huish, in his treatise on Bees, has
twice described the manner in which "<i>driving
a hive</i>" may be performed; but nowhere, that
I can find, has he once recommended it. In
a note (in page 24) he says&mdash;-that "by <i>driving
a hive</i> may be understood the act of obliging
the Bees to leave their own domicil, and take
refuge in another. This is performed by
placing the full hive under an empty one, (or
he might have said, by placing an empty hive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"> 91 </a></span>
upon the full one inverted) and by gently
tapping the lower hive the Bees will ascend
into the upper, and the lower one then remains
vacant for experiments, or the purpose of
deprivation." He afterwards (in page 252)
gives a more detailed account of the manner
of performing this operation; and having done
so, he presently observes that "by the driving
of the Bees a number is unavoidably killed."
I do not find that Mr. Huish himself practises
it further than for the purpose of making
experiments; and that, having made those
experiments, he returns the driven Bees to
their hives and to their treasures in them. In
short, he describes it to his readers because
they may wish to be acquainted with it, and
not because he approves of it. I mention this
because I consider Mr. Huish to be respectable
authority on such a subject.</p>

<p>Now, were there nothing in a hive but Bees
and honey, driving them into an empty hive
(were it as easy in practice as it seems to be
upon paper, though I presume it is not) in
order to rob them of their all, would be a most
arbitrary and unjust method of treating them:
but, besides Bees and honey, there are other
substances in a prosperous hive which ought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"> 92 </a></span>
not to be disturbed. There are the future
inhabitants of the colony in every stage of
existence, from the egg to the perfect Bee, and
these in a driven hive are all totally destroyed&mdash;eggs,
larv, nymphs, in one word, <i>the brood</i>,
in whatever state, is all destroyed, when the Bees
are driven from it and not suffered to return.
And is it not an unnatural operation that thus
destroys many thousands of lives in embryo,
over and above the "<i>number unavoidably
killed</i>" thereby? as painful must it be for the
Queen&mdash;the mother of the colony, and to all
the other Bees, to be <i>forcibly expelled</i> from a
hive and home of plenty and prosperity, as it
is for an industrious man and his thriving
family to be rudely ejected from a comfortable
house and home, without the least notice of,
or preparation for, so calamitous an event, and
forced by lawless marauders to take shelter in
an empty house, and left there destitute, to
subsist as best they can, or to starve, as
probably they may, their spirits being cast
down by the violent deprivations and desperate
robbery they have experienced, and it may be,
the winds, and the weather, and the elements
of heaven, are warring, as it were, against
them at the same time. And, comparatively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"> 93 </a></span>
speaking, is it not so with <i>driven</i> Bees? They
are turned topsy-turvy, and in that strange,
unnatural position their fears are operated
upon, or excited, by unusual, and to them, no
doubt, terrible sounds made by even "gently
tapping" their inverted-hive&mdash;their house
turned upside down. Though no advocate for
suffocating Bees, but the contrary&mdash;a decided
opponent to it, I agree in opinion with my
correspondent that suffocation at once is
preferable to the very reprehensible practice of
"driving a hive," inasmuch as an instantaneous
death is preferable to a lingering and unnatural
one by starvation, which, whatever may befal
the driven Bees, is the hard, untimely fate of
the brood and young larv of a hive when the
Queen and commoners are driven from them
into a new and empty domicil. They leave,
because they are forced to leave behind them,
and to perish, thousands of the young brood
in a state of helplessness. Their mother and
their nurses are driven into banishment and
pauperism, while her offspring are doomed to
perish for the want of their aid and support.
If driving be practised early in the season,
that is in June or July, all the brood then in
the driven hive must inevitably perish; if later,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"> 94 </a></span>
it is hardly to be expected that the surviving
Bees will or can prosper. Can the Bee-master
for a moment think that when Bees are so
driven from their old hive, they will work
in their new one, as if they had swarmed
voluntarily and then been put into it: it is some
considerable time before Bees thus treated
will work vigorously; and during that time
of lingering and irresolution the honey-season
fast declines,&mdash;the Bees' difficulties multiply,&mdash;and
they become paupers at a time they
should be rich. Nine times out of ten the
hive so treated perishes by famine, and like
the young brood, dies the worst of deaths,&mdash;the
whole hive becomes a melancholy wreck,
and is absolutely sacrificed to the mistaken
notions of the speculating, or experiment-making
proprietor. It is a practice of which
<i>I disapprove altogether</i>: and I am surprised
that any one could so far misunderstand the
principles and nature of my practice as to
recommend the driving of Bees out of a full
hive into an empty one as an admirable
addition to my Bee-hive&mdash;that is&mdash;to my
Bee-boxes. I have the satisfaction, however,
to state that in the management of Bees in
my boxes <i>no driving is necessary, nor even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"> 95 </a></span>
possible</i>: by them <i>driving</i> and <i>suffocation</i> are
both superseded, and rendered as useless to
operators as they have long been destructive
to Bees,&mdash;and, I cannot but say&mdash;disgraceful
to apiarians. What I have already said (in
<a href="#Page_48">page 48</a>) I will here repeat with as much
emphasis as I am able, because that passage
comprehends the very essence of my directions
relative to the management of Bees in the
middle-box,&mdash;and because those directions
are utterly incompatible with <i>driving</i>. "I
say, then, <span class="smcap">disturb not this hive&mdash;this
pavilion of nature: weaken not
its population; rut support its influence,
and extend to it those
accommodations which no practice,
except my own, has yet put into
operation, or made any adequate
provision for</span>.</p>

<p>"This humane practice partakes not of the
<i>driving</i>, nor of the <i>fumigating</i>, nor of the
<i>robbing</i> system. It is a <i>liberal principle</i> of
Bee-cultivation, founded on <i>humanity</i>. And
it is by such practice that we must succeed,
if we hope to be benefited in the culture of
Honey-Bees."</p>

<p>If, therefore, a beautifully delicate honey-comb
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"> 97 </a></span>
suspended from the stool of a hive first led
me to discover the utility of ventilation in a
colony of Bees, though there may be nothing
very surprising, there is, I trust,&mdash;nay, I am
convinced, and therefore I assert&mdash;there is
something very useful in it: and if an accident
of another description induced me to endeavour
to turn it to advantage, there is nothing to
be greatly wondered at. So, however, it
happened; and here follows the account of it.</p>

<p>On rising early one morning in July 1827,
and walking into my apiary, as my custom
then was, and still is, I discovered that some
malicious wretch had been there before me,
and had overturned a fine colony of Bees.
The reader may judge how much my indignation
was aroused by that dastardly act of
outrage against my unoffending Bees. My
feelings of vexation soon, however, subsided
into those of pity for my poor Bees; and
fortunately for them, no less than for me,
their overturned domicil, which consisted of
a hive eked or enlarged by a square box upon
which I had placed it some weeks previously,
was so shaded from or towards the east by a
thick fence, that the rays of the sun had not
reached it;&mdash;this compound-hive, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"> 98 </a></span>
countless thousands that were clustering around
it, were prostrate in the shade. I viewed my
distressed Bees for a considerable time, and
studied and planned what I might best do to
relieve them, and, if possibly I could, rescue
them from the deplorable situation into which
they had been thrown. At length I determined
to reverse the whole, which I effected by first
carefully drawing the box as closely as I was
able to the edge of the hive, and then placing
the hive upon its crown, so that, in fact, the
whole domicil was inverted. I shaded, protected,
shored-up, and supported the Bees,
their exposed works, and their hive, in the
best way I could, and afterwards reluctantly
left them for the day, being under the necessity
of going from home a distance of almost twenty
miles, viz. to Wisbech. On my return in the
evening I could discern evident proofs of the
willingness of the Bees to repair the sore injury
they had sustained; and on the third day
afterwards I was highly pleased to witness
the progress their united efforts had made to
rescue their dilapidated habitation from the
ruin that had threatened it and them too, and
which, I confess, I had anticipated. I was
particularly attentive to their movements. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"> 99 </a></span>
assisted them by every means I could devise.
They gradually surmounted all the difficulties
to which they had been exposed. In short,
they prospered; and from that malicious trick
of some miscreant or other I first caught the
idea of an <i>inverted-hive</i>, which I have since
studied and greatly improved.</p>

<p>Every Bee-master will have had opportunities
of observing&mdash;that this curious, I may
say&mdash;intelligent, little insect&mdash;the Bee, is ever
alive to the most ready methods of extricating
itself from difficulties, and of bettering the
condition of the state, whenever accident or
misfortune has placed it in jeopardy: and, I
will add&mdash;that the timely assistance of the
Bee-master will frequently save a stock from
that ruin, or at least from that trouble and
inconvenience, which apparently trivial circumstances,
such for instance as uncleanliness,
excessive heat in summer, intense severity of
winter, too contracted an entrance at one season,
a too extended and open one at another,
or wet lodged on and retained by the floor-board,
may, and very often do occasion.</p>

Bees. Its diameter within the wood, I mean
its <i>clear diameter</i>, is seventeen inches, and its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"> 101 </a></span>
depth, or rather its height, is fifteen or sixteen
inches, or just sufficient to reach to, and be
level with, the edge of the inverted cottage-hive,
when placed within it: in fact, the
octagon-box (A.) is a strong case or cover for
the inverted-hive; and, if made an inch or
two deeper than the hive to be placed in it, it
is an easy matter to pack the bottom, so that
the edge of the hive and the top-edge of the
octagon-box (A.) may be exactly on a level.
Fitted and fastened to this is a top or floor,
made of three-fourths-inch deal, which top
should sit closely upon the edge of the hive
all round. The centre of this top is cut out
circularly to within an inch and a half of the
inner circumference or edge of the hive upon
and over which it is placed. Upon this floor
is a box, made of inch or inch-and-quarter
deal, seventeen inches square within, and four
inches deep. This I call the ventilation-box,
because through two of its opposite sides are
introduced horizontally two cylinder ventilating-tubes,
made of tin, thickly perforated,
and in all respects similar to those described
in <a href="#Page_20">page 20</a>. The top of this box is the floor
upon which nine glasses are placed for the
reception of honey, namely&mdash;a large bell-glass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"> 102 </a></span>
in the centre, and eight smaller ones around it.
By a <i>large</i> bell-glass I mean&mdash;one capable of
containing twelve or fourteen pounds of honey,
and by <i>smaller</i> ones&mdash;such as will hold about
four pounds. The Bees of an inverted-hive
in a good situation will work well in glasses of
these sizes, and soon fill some or all of them:
but, if in an unfavourable situation, lesser
glasses, down to one-half the abovementioned
sizes, will be more suitable. Situation, season,
and strength of the stock,&mdash;strength, I mean,
as respects the number of Bees, must, after
all, guide the apiarian in this matter. The
floor abovementioned should be made of three-fourths-inch
deal. Of course proper apertures
must be cut through this floor under each of
the glasses to admit the Bees into them from
the box beneath. Around and over the glasses
is placed another neat box or case, made like
the ventilation-box, upon which it rests or
stands. The lid of this box is made to open
and shut. It is represented in the foregoing
cut as opened at B. an inch or two, and may
be so retained at pleasure by a proper weight
attached to a cord passed over a pulley fixed
in the inside of the roof (C.) and fastened to
the edge of the lid above B. The depth of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"> 103 </a></span>
the box or cover for the glasses must of course
be regulated according to their different sizes.
The alighting-board is on the front-side, directly
opposite to the latticed doors, and on a
level with the upper-side of the first floor; so
that the entrance for the Bees must be cut
through the lower edge of the ventilation-box;
and is made there most conveniently for them
to pass either into the inverted pavilion below,
or into the glasses above such entrance, as
their inclinations may direct.</p>

<p>The octagon-cover placed upon the pavilion-hive,
as represented in the view of the closed
boxes (in <a href="#Page_29">page 29</a>) if <i>inverted</i>, would be a
tolerably good model of part A. of the inverted-hive.</p>

<p>I advise that every part be well-made&mdash;the
floors and the boxes particularly so; and that
the whole exterior be well painted too, previously
to being exposed to the sun and to the
weather. This advice has reference to all my
boxes and hives, collateral as well as inverted.</p>

<p>The stocking of this hive may be effected in
the following manner. Having made choice
of a good, healthy, well-stocked, cottage-hive,
you may, at any time between the beginning
of March and the end of October, <i>carefully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"> 104 </a></span>
invert and place it in the octagon below the
ventilation-box</i>, that is, in the apartment (A.)
then fasten the floor with four short screws to
the top of the octagon, taking especial care
that this floor sits upon the edge of the
inverted-hive all round. It will be necessary
to keep the Bees from annoying you whilst
adjusting this floor and the other parts of the
hive, by putting a sheet of tin over the open
circular space in the floor; by which tin every
Bee may be kept in the hive below. When
the boxes, ventilators, glasses, and all things,
are duly adjusted, the dividing-tin may be
withdrawn; and the operation of stocking will
be then completed.</p>

<p>Another method of accomplishing the same
object, i. e. of stocking an inverted-hive, is this:</p>

<p>Take the floor that is to rest upon, and be
fastened to, the top of the octagon A. and
that is to rest also upon the hive when inverted,
and with a sheet of tin cover and securely
close the circular space made by cutting out
its centre: then invert it, that is&mdash;let the
tinned side be undermost, and place upon this
floor, thus prepared, the hive you intend to be
inverted. Return it to, and suffer it to occupy,
its usual place in your apiary; and <i>there</i> for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"> 105 </a></span>
two or three weeks let it work   in which time
the Bees will have fastened the hive to their
new board with propolis. Then, early in the
morning, or late in the evening, when all the
Bees are in the hive, make up the entrance,
and, having two doors made in opposite panels
or sides of the octagon (A.) ten inches by six,
or sufficiently commodious for the admission
of your hands, <i>steadily invert</i> your hive and
prepared board upon which it has been standing,
and, without sundering from the hive
the board that will now be at its top, <i>carefully</i>
place them in the octagon; which, with the
help of an assistant, and by the facility
afforded by the two little doors in the panels
of the octagon for staying and properly supporting
and adjusting the hive and its attached
floor, may be performed without the escape
of a single Bee. As soon as this, which is
properly the inversion of the hive, is completed,
proceed with the ventilation-box, glasses, &amp;c.
as before directed; and, lastly, be careful to
liberate the Bees by withdrawing the tin that
has kept them prisoners since the entrance
was closed. In inverting a hive by this
method an expert apiarian need not confine
the Bees five minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"> 106 </a></span></p>

<p>The Bees will commence their labour by
filling the square box between the pavilion
and the glasses; they will then extend their
beautiful combs into the glasses above. The
appearance of their most curious works in
this stage of their labour is highly interesting&mdash;nay,
gratifying, to the apiarian observer; and,
moreover, proves the extraordinary influence
and utility of ventilation in the domicil, or,
rather let me say, in the store-house apartment
of Bees; for in the pavilion, or breeding and
nursing apartment, it is seldom wanted.</p>

<p>The method of taking off the glasses,
whether large ones or small ones, when stored
with honey, is in every respect the same as
that of which a particular account has been
already given, (in <a href="#Page_37">pages 37 and 38</a>): to that
account, therefore, I beg to refer the reader,
instead of here repeating it.</p>

<p>The observatory-hive, as here exhibited in
<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>, consists of two apartments&mdash;an upper
one and a lower one. The upper one, (marked
a. b. c. d. e. e.) is properly the observatory-hive,
and may be called the summer-pavilion;
the lower one, (marked g.) may be termed the
winter-pavilion. Of this winter-pavilion but
little need be said, except that it is an
octagonal box, in size, in substance, and in
every respect, similar to the octagon-part of
the <i>inverted-hive</i> described in the last chapter;
save only that its top must not be cut away,
as is there directed to be done. At present
let us suppose this top to be a perfect plane&mdash;an
entire surface, without any aperture of
any sort to form a passage for the Bees
from and through it down into the pavilion
below; farther let us suppose an alighting-board
of the usual size to be fixed in front,
and on a level with this floor or top; then
the qure will be&mdash;how, from the same front-entrance,
the Bees are to have a passage both
into the observatory-hive above, and into the
winter-pavilion below? The difficulty is&mdash;to
get a convenient passage into the summer-pavilion,
because the whole of that pavilion
is made to turn round on the shoulder of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"> 111 </a></span>
upright shaft, through which shaft the passage
for the Bees must of necessity be made, and
which does not admit of a bore of above an
inch in diameter. As, however, this narrow,
perpendicular passage is of no great length,
(it need not be more than three inches) many
thousands of Bees will, in the course of a few
minutes, if necessary, make their egress and
regress through it without incommoding one
another. That this rather intricate part&mdash;the
construction of this passage-work&mdash;may be
fully comprehended, I will endeavour to illustrate
it by references to a well-known article,
now standing on the table, on which I am
writing. It is a telescopic candlestick, the
pedestal of which covers a square space upon
my table, each side of which superficial
square is three inches. Now suppose this
candlestick was screwed or glued to the centre
of the plain, tabular top of the octagon (g.)
having one of its sides parallel to that side of
the floor to which the alighting-board is
attached. Next, suppose <i>that</i> side of the
candlestick to be cut away so as to form an
entrance into the interior of the pedestal, two
inches in front and half an inch in height;
and let there be a covered-way of this height,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"> 112 </a></span>
from the opened side of the pedestal to the
front-entrance of the hive: then, if the front-entrance
be six inches wide, the Bees on
coming in will enter this covered-way, which
from six inches narrows to three at the part
where they enter the pedestal, and begin to
ascend the perpendicular passage which leads
through it and through the upright shaft of
the candlestick into the&mdash;at present&mdash;<i>supposed</i>
apartment above. The top-part of a telescopic
candlestick may be turned round at pleasure;
consequently, if the pedestal be fixed and
made immoveable, the top, and whatever may
be upon that top and fastened to it, may be
moved round notwithstanding: this is what
we particularly want in the construction of an
observatory-hive, and must, therefore, be particularly
attended to. A piece of clean, close-grained
wood&mdash;beech, elder, mahogany, or
any other firm wood&mdash;made much in the shape
of our telescopic candlestick, but of not more
than two inches and a half in height, with a
bore through it of an inch in diameter, and
turned, that is, wrought in a lathe, so that an
inch of the top-part may enter into, and
neatly fit, the cap fixed round the inch bore at
the centre of the bottom-frame of the upper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"> 113 </a></span>
pavilion (<a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>), and which cap is represented
by the moveable top of the candlestick, is, as
well as I can describe it, the pedestal to support
the observatory-hive,&mdash;is, with the cap just
mentioned, the compound, or double-hinge
upon which that hive is turned round,&mdash;and
is also the Bee-way into that hive.</p>

<p>The way into the winter-pavilion, or octagon
(g.) is made by cutting a circular hole through
the very centre of the plane top, an inch in
diameter, directly under the upward passage;
so that the Bees, whether their way be into
the summer-pavilion above, or into the winter-pavilion
below, lies through the pedestal, and
the only difference is, that one passage leads
upwards and the other downwards. The
covered-way which has been so often mentioned,
may easily be made by taking out of
the under-side of the bottom-board of the
paneled and roofed box, made to secure the
observatory-hive, and which is placed upon
the top of the winter-pavilion, just as much as
will allow a sufficient space for that way.</p>

<p>Having completed the passages, my next
business is&mdash;to describe the novel apartment
into which the passage through the pedestal
leads&mdash;that is, the real observatory-hive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"> 114 </a></span></p>

<p><a href="#Fig_2">Figure 2</a> shows the upper glass-frame of this
hive with two small circular openings through
the top of each arm, over which openings are
placed small glasses, (at e. e.) in both Figures,
for receptacles for honey, and are intended to
answer the same purpose as those do which are
placed upon the inverted-hive. A line drawn
from one extremity of any one of these arms
or wings, to the extremity of the arm or wing
directly opposite to it, is twenty-three inches;
and the distance between the dotted lines,
which are intended to mark the glass-way, or,
in joiners' phrase, the <i>rebate</i> to receive the
edges of the glass, is exactly one inch and
three-fourths. The lower glass-frame, which
(in <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>) is placed upon f. the shaft of the
pedestal already described, is the exact counterpart
of the upper frame, with the exception
of its not having any perforations for honey-glasses:
the only perforation in this frame is
that at its centre; which must be made to
correspond with that of the shaft, and be a
continuation of the Bee-passage into the hive.
These two frames are connected and made
one by four upright pieces, or ends, (marked
a. b. c. d. in <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>,) these upright, end-pieces
must be rebated, or channeled, to receive the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"> 115 </a></span>
ends of the glass-plates. Eight squares of
glass, each ten inches and a half by ten inches,
fastened with putty into this frame-work,&mdash;that
is, two squares into each wing, will
complete the glass-hive; which, when placed
upon the top of the pedestal, and made steady
by an axis fixed at the central point of the
upper frame, and turning in a socket under
the ball, constitutes <i>an observatory-hive</i>. Confined
as is the space between the glass-plates
in each wing, they being but an inch and
three-fourths apart, there is, nevertheless,
room enough for the construction of one comb;
and space for more than one comb would spoil
it as an observatory-hive: and, though each
wing may appear to be but small, there are
upwards of 760 cubic inches of clear space in
the hive. It is so constructed that plenty of
light and the utmost transparency are afforded
for observing and minutely examining the Bees
and the works of the Bees in all their stages.
Indeed the grand object of this contrivance is&mdash;to
expose to view the labours of the Bees in
the inside of their hive; and as the machine
may be moved round at pleasure, not a Bee
can enter it, without being observed, nor can
a single cell be constructed in secret. I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"> 116 </a></span>
only add&mdash;that the appearance of the Bees in
this hive is beautiful, and excites admiration
and surprise,&mdash;nay, is capable of enlivening
the drooping spirits of the most desponding
apiarian; for who can view the Queen of the
hive constantly laying her eggs, and, by so
doing, constantly propagating her species,
and her thousands of loyal subjects, whose
indefatigable labour in all its parts is so
conspicuous, without experiencing sensations
of the purest pleasure,&mdash;nay, more of gratitude
to God for his goodness to man!</p>

<p>It has been suggested to me by some ingenious
friends&mdash;that a couple of magnifying
glasses set in the doors, and some mechanical
contrivance to open a part of the roof by
simply pulling a cord, and to throw a proper
light upon the four wings of the hive, would
be a great improvement; because, by these
means, or by some such means as these, the
opening and shutting of the doors would be
rendered unnecessary,&mdash;and, because the Bees
and their curious works would be more interesting
by being viewed through magnifying
glasses,&mdash;and because the exterior appearance
of the whole concern would be more handsome.
Without the slightest hesitation I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"> 117 </a></span>
admit&mdash;that, to those persons to whom expense
is no object, the mode of examining
the observatory-hive would be improved by
some such arrangements as those just mentioned;
but <i>the hive itself would not be improved
in the least</i>,&mdash;it would remain just as it was
before these costly additions, whether ornamental,
or useful, or both, were made to its
covering only&mdash;<i>not to the hive</i>.</p>

<p>The following cut will, in some degree,
represent and tacitly explain an observatory-hive,
fitted up in this way.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a name="CHAPTER_VIIa" id="CHAPTER_VIIa"></a>THE MODE OF STOCKING AN OBSERVATORY-HIVE.</p>

<p>This operation may be performed in various
ways, and almost at any time during the
summer months, by an experienced apiarian.
I will content myself with describing <i>how</i> it may
be done most easily, if not most scientifically,
by any person possessed of courage enough to
operate at all among Bees. It is as follows:</p>

<p>When your Bees swarm from a cottage-hive,
take it (the swarm) into a common hive in the
usual way 7 place it in a cool, shaded situation,
and let it remain there until the evening; and
even then attempt no further operation, unless
the Bees be all settled and quite still. When
they are all within their hive, peaceable, and
retired, as it were, for the night, you may
suddenly strike them from their hive upon a
clean, white sheet, spread over a table prepared
and ready for the purpose, and within the
space occupied, or rather&mdash;enclosed, by four
bricks placed edgewise. Upon these bricks
place your glass-hive as expeditiously as possible
with its entrance just over the Bees.
Then envelope your hive with a cloth so as to
darken its interior, and, lastly, throw the
corners of the sheet over the whole. This
done, the Bees will presently ascend into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"> 120 </a></span>
wings of the hive. When they are all safely
lodged in it, you may carefully remove the
sheet and the other coverings; and, having
securely made up the entrance into the winter-pavilion,
then place the stocked hive upon
its pedestal, and the Bees will be ready to
commence their labour the next day.</p>

<p>At the latter end of August invert the parent-hive
from which the swarm issued, and place
it in the octagon-box (g.) below the summer-pavilion.
Take out the plug that is between
the two hives, that is&mdash;open the passage into
the winter-hive, and you will have accomplished
the union of the two families: they will join or
unite, and thenceforward continue to labour as
one family. By this movement you give to your
Bees a winter-residence, secure from all enemies,
which are numerous at this season. And so
well-stocked will the winter-hive be, that an
early swarm from it, for the observatory-hive, the
following season may reasonably be expected.</p>

<p>The honey may be taken from the e. e.
glasses, placed upon the arms of the summer-pavilion
so easily, by turning round the loose
boards under the glasses, that further explanation
is unnecessary. The machine itself will
point out to the perfect stranger the proper
method of doing it.</p>

<p class="caption3">FUMIGATION.</p>


<p>Fumigation is a rather portentous word;
but, as soon as I shall have explained for what
purposes, and in what manner, I occasionally
make use of it, it will be totally divested of all
deadly signification. In my practice it is not
a Bee-destroyer, but a Bee-preserver;&mdash;when
resorted to by me it is never carried, nor intended
to be carried, to suffocation: but, in
the operation of uniting weak swarms or poor
stocks with more wealthy and prosperous ones&mdash;which
I consider to be a meritorious and
most humane practice,&mdash;when it is necessary
to examine the state and condition of even a
populous colony, should unfavourable symptoms
as to its healthiness or its prosperity
manifest themselves,&mdash;when it is known, or
but suspected, that there are wax-moths, mice,
spiders, or other Bee-enemies lodged in a hive,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"> 122 </a></span>
which the Bees of themselves cannot dislodge
nor get rid of; and which, if not got rid of by
man's assistance, would soon destroy almost
any colony,&mdash;when Bees and their works (for
I never transfer the former without transferring
an ample sufficiency of the latter at the same
time) are to be taken out of a decayed straw-hive,
in order to be put into a more substantial
one, or into collateral-boxes, which I hold to
be the best of all hives,&mdash;and on innumerable
other occasions, it is absolutely necessary <i>to
subdue Bees</i> so far as to render them incapable
of using that formidable, venomous, little weapon,
with which Providence has armed them,
and which generally dreaded little weapon they
can use so dexterously, before we can operate
upon them for their own good. By means of
a very simple apparatus, which may be called
<i>a fumigator</i>, and which is a contrivance as
novel and as useful in the management of
Bees, as any of my hives or other inventions,
<i>Bees may be totally subdued without being
injured in the slightest degree, and dealt with
as if they had neither stings nor wings</i>.</p>

<p>I beg, however, to re-state distinctly&mdash;that,
in taking off a box or a glass of honey, <i>no fumigation
whatever is necessary</i>, or ever practised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"> 123 </a></span>
by me. It is only in cases such as those just
enumerated that I have recourse to it; but in no
case for the destruction of Bees. Fumigation,
therefore, in my practice, is not suffocation.</p>

<p>The following figure is a representation of
a fumigator, which a brief explanation will
render intelligible.</p>

<p>This useful article consists of a square top-board
upon which is placed a straw-hive (E.)
so as to show an open, circular space under the
hive and through the square board into the
bag below. I need hardly observe&mdash;that the
straw-hive is no part of the fumigator, but is
here represented as standing upon it in order
to exemplify its use. The top-board is of
inch-deal, and is nineteen or twenty inches
square. A round piece is cut out of its centre
of not more than thirteen inches in diameter&mdash;that
being something near to, or perhaps rather
more than, the inside diameter of a common
hive&mdash;so that a hive will stand upon the
wooden circumference of the part left, without
there being any ledge inside, that is&mdash;any
part so enclosed by the hive as to catch and
detain the falling Bees. From the upper-edge
of this circle is suspended a bag, a yard in
length, made of glazed calico, the bottom-part
of which draws round the rim of a shallow,
funnel-shaped, tin Bee-receiver, which Bee-receiver
is about ten inches across at the top,
and its lower part, or neck (D. or F.) is three
inches and a half in length, and its throat (if I
may so term it) is nearly three inches in width.
To fit this neck, which is thickly perforated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"> 125 </a></span>
for the purpose of admitting fresh air, when
fresh air may be required, is a close lid, just
like that of a common, tin canister, to hold
up the fumigated Bees, and also to stop the
ventilation when not wanted. C. is the fumigating-lamp
with a perforated top through
which the fume ascends, and is made conical,
so that a fumigated Bee in its fall cannot
rest upon it and be thereby scorched or injured,
as would inevitably be the case were this top
flat. The tie (B.) closes the bag and keeps
every Bee above until the lamp and every
thing below be adjusted, and it is <i>then</i> to be
untied. The fumigator is here represented as
standing upon three legs made fast to the
top-board by small bolts, as at A.; but it is
quite as convenient in practice, and more portable,
if, instead of these legs, it be made like
a common scale with a cord from each corner,
which may be gathered into a small iron-hook,
and thereby suspended from the branch of a
tree, or from any other convenient place, when
used. The lower part of the bag is represented
as being transparent, but that is done purposely
to show how the lamp is placed inside when
prepared for operation.</p>

<p>By persons inexperienced in such matters
it may be thought to be an extraordinary feat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"> 126 </a></span>
to unite the Bees of one hive with those of
another&mdash;-to bind, as it were, the legs and
wings, and pro tempore, to render useless the
sting of every individual Bee, until such union
be effected. Nothing, however, is more easy;
nor is any part of apiarian practice attended
with more pleasing consequences to the operator,
or with more important and beneficial
ones to the Bees themselves. When in a
state of temporary intoxication from the fume
made to ascend through the perforated tin (C.)
into their hive, these beautiful insects are
perfectly manageable,&mdash;perfectly harmless.</p>

<p>This intoxicating fume is caused by introducing
into the fumigating-lamp a piece of
ignited vegetable substance, called puck,
puckball, or frog-cheese, or, most commonly,
<i>fuzzball</i>. It is a species of fungus, or mushroom,
and is plentiful enough in the autumn in
rank pastures and in rich edishes. Shepherds,
milk-maids, or country-school boys are well
acquainted with them,&mdash;know very well where
to find them,&mdash;and for a mere trifle will easily
pick up as many of them as will supply the
demands of twenty apiarians. They are frequently
as large as a man's head, or larger.
In 1826 I had an unripe, white puckball, which
weighed ten pounds. When ripe they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"> 127 </a></span>
internally of a brown colour, and turning
spongy and powdery become exceedingly
light, and are then properly <i>fuzzballs</i>. For
the substance of the following directions
respecting the preparation of fuzzballs for
Bee-fumigation, and for its application to that
occasionally necessary purpose, I have no
hesitation in acknowledging myself to be
indebted to Thorley's treatise on Bees&mdash;no
mean authority on such a subject.</p>

<p>When you have procured one of these pucks,
put it into a large piece of stout paper,&mdash;press
it down therein to two-thirds, or, if you can, to
one-half, of its original size, and then tie it
up closely,&mdash;and, lastly, put it into an oven
sometime after the household bread has been
drawn, that is, when the oven is nearly cool,
and let it remain there all night, or, until it
will hold fire and smother away like touch-wood,
i. e. burn without kindling into flame.
In this state it is fit for the fumigating-lamp,
and may be used in the manner following,
when the union of two stocks is the apiarian's
object.</p>

<p>Take a piece of this prepared fungus, as
large as a hen's egg, (it is better to have too
much of it than too little to begin with) ignite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"> 128 </a></span>
one end of it with a candle, and then put it
into the fumigating-lamp,&mdash;next fix the lamp
in its socket over the Bee-receiver, and place
the whole inside the bag, as shown in the
plate, and untie B&mdash;the fastening round the
middle. In a very short space of time the
Bees in the hive placed upon the top-board
(which is necessarily the first thing to be
attended to in every operation of this kind)
will be totally under your control. The
operator should be particularly careful to close
every vacancy, however small, that there may
happen to be between the top-board and the
edge of the hive, by tying a cloth round it&mdash;the
hive&mdash;as soon as ever it is placed upon
the board. This precaution will prevent the
escape of any of the fume, and will also
prevent the Bees from annoying the operator
during the time he is making the arrangements
necessary previously to every fumigating
process.</p>

<p>In the course of a minute or very little more
you will hear the Bees dropping like hail into
their receiver, at the bottom of the fumigating
apparatus.</p>

<p>When the major part of them are down, and
you hear but few fall, gently beat the top of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"> 129 </a></span>
the hive with your hands, in order to get
as many down as you can. Then, having
loosened the cloth, lift the hive off and set it
upon a table, or upon a broad board, prepared
for the purpose, and knocking the hive against
it several times, many more Bees will fall
down, and perhaps the Queen amongst the
rest; for, as she generally lodges near the
crown of the hive, or is driven thither by the
fume, and surrounded and protected there by
the other Bees to the very last, and as long
ever they have the power loyally to cling
round her, she often falls one of the last. If
the Queen is not among the Bees on the table,
search for her among the main body in the
Bee-receiver; first, however, putting them
upon the table, if you discover her not before
lying among the uppermost Bees therein.</p>

<p>During this search for the Queen, or with
as little delay as possible, you, or some one
for you, should be proceeding in a similar
manner with the Bees in the other hive, with
which those already fumigated are to be united.
As soon as the Bees of the hive last fumigated
are all composed and quiet, and you have
found and secured one of the Queens, you
may put the Bees of both hives together into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"> 130 </a></span>
an empty one, for the purpose of mingling
them thoroughly together, and of sprinkling
them at the same time with a little ale and
sugar; this done, put them and <i>one only</i> of
the two Queens among the combs of the hive
you intend them to inhabit, and gently shake
them down into it. When you have thus got
all the Bees of your two hives into one, cover
it with a cloth and closely bind the corners of
that cloth about it, and let them stand during
that night and the next day, shut or closed
up in this manner, so that a Bee may not
get out; but not so close as to smother them
for want of air.</p>

<p>In the evening of the following day, having
previously removed the hive, containing your
united-stock, to its proper stand, viz. that
which it had occupied before the operation,
loose the corners of the cloth and remove it
from the mouth of the hive, and the Bees will,
with a great noise, immediately sally forth;
but being too late to take wing, they will
presently go in again; and remain satisfied in
and with their new abode&mdash;new at least, to
one-half of them, and new to the other half
also when transferred into a fresh hive, or into
boxes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"> 131 </a></span></p>

<p>But in taking away the cloth discretion and
caution must be used, because the Bees will
for some time resent the affront put upon them
by such to them, no doubt, offensive treatment.</p>

<p>The best time of the year for unions of weak
stocks with strong ones is in autumn, after
the young brood are all out&mdash;in the latter part
of August, or any time during September:
but for removals of stocks from straw-hives
into boxes, the best time is early in the spring
before the eggs of the Queen have changed
and quickened into larv,&mdash;I will say&mdash;in the
month of March; and if the weather is cold,
it is advisable to perform the operation in a
room where the temperature is about 60
degrees. For if Bees are displaced, that is&mdash;taken
from their hive, in a cold atmosphere, it
is but rarely that they recover from the effects
of the fume so as to marshal themselves into
working order in a box or new hive. But
this they can do, and will do most effectually,
under this agreeable temperature. As twelve
hours are sufficient for the Bees to regain their
former independency in their new domicil,
you may place them at the end of that period
on their summer stool, and they will work, as
soon as the weather will permit them, as if they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"> 132 </a></span>
had never been removed from their former
hive, nor in any way disturbed.</p>

<p>The great number of operations of this kind,
which I have performed before hundreds of
admiring and gratified spectators, chiefly of
the higher ranks of society, renders it almost
unnecessary for me to observe&mdash;that once
being present at and witnessing it, will convey
a more perfect idea of the whole performance
than any written description of it can give.
If, however, any gentleman, or other apiarian
friend, who has not yet seen the performance
of this operation, should be desirous of witnessing
it, the author will freely undertake
that, or any other Bee-service in his power, by
which he can oblige, assist, or instruct him.</p>

<p>The same degree of precaution is not
necessary on the removing of the Bees of a
cottage-hive on my principle; it is only
requisite in the particular case of joining or
uniting two or more hives together, that such
nice management need be observed. And
certainly the more expeditiously the whole is
performed, the more pleasing will be the
result of the operation, and the more certain
of success.</p>

<p>I will conclude this subject with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"> 133 </a></span>
anecdote:&mdash;In the year 1828, I was engaged
by the Honourable Lady Gifford, of Roehampton,
to unite the Bees of two hives; and as
the operation was novel to the spectators, who
on that occasion consisted principally of the
branches of that worthy family,&mdash;when I had
drawn the Bees from the cottage-hive and they
were all spread on a white cloth, and every
eye was anxiously intent upon discovering the
Queen-Bee, there was some trouble in finding
that particular Bee; even I myself&mdash;an old
practitioner&mdash;had overlooked her; and having
occasion to leave the table and my fumigated
Bees surrounded by my young Lord and Lady
Gifford, and by the rest of her Ladyship's
family, her infant son, in the arms of his nurse,
eagerly called out&mdash;"Mamma, mamma, what
is that?" Hearing the child's animated expression,
I returned to the table, and instantly
beheld and caught the Queen of the Bees,&mdash;and
her actually pointed out by an infant not
three years of age. Is there any excuse then
for not knowing the Queen-Bee? And, as a
true description of this Bee and of the office
she fulfils in the hive, will be given in the
course of this work, accompanied with a plate
of her and also of the other Bees, I trust my
Bee-friends will not hereafter allow a child of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"> 134 </a></span>
only three years of age (although that child
was the son of a late Attorney-General,) to
excel them in this particular point of apiarian
knowledge, which is not only highly interesting,
but very useful to the operator, when uniting
stocks, or transferring Bees from one domicil
to another. Never shall I forget the look of
satisfaction that beamed on the countenance
of the affectionate mother. To see each of
her eight amiable children around the table
with her Ladyship, minutely searching every
little cluster of Bees, in order to give the first
information of the Queen, was a lovely sight;
but to hear her infant son proclaim, as it were,
the Queen of the Bees, by pointing his little,
delicate finger to the object of his curiosity,
and exclaim&mdash;"Mamma, mamma, what is
that?" was most gratifying even to me. Well
might the little naturalist inquire&mdash;"what is
that?" when he was in the presence of royalty,
and pointing to one of the most extraordinary
monarchs in the world, while I myself&mdash;an old
practitioner, had not previously observed her.
Be it so, I acknowledge my oversight in this
instance, and feel it incumbent on me to give
the merit of the discovery to him, to whom on
that occasion it was so justly due.</p>

<p class="caption3">OBJECTIONS AGAINST PILING BOXES.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">Having</span> gone through the explanation of my
different hives, and of all my Bee-machinery,
I will, previously to entering upon other
matters, here state my objections to the
piling of Bee-boxes one upon another, which
is sometimes, and not improperly, called&mdash;<i>storifying</i>.
It is also termed super-hiving,
nadir-hiving, or centre-hiving, according to the
place occupied by the added box: if an empty
box be placed upon a stocked one, it is <i>super-hiving</i>;&mdash;if
put <i>under</i> such box, it is <i>nadir-hiving</i>;&mdash;and
if introduced <i>between</i> two boxes,
it is <i>centre-hiving</i>. But with whatever term
dignified&mdash;not to say&mdash;mystified, it amounts
to, and in effect is&mdash;<i>storifying</i>. From an old
book in my possession I find&mdash;that in 1675 a
patent was granted to John Gedde, to secure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"> 136 </a></span>
to him for a term of fourteen years the advantages
of his invention of boxes for storifying;
so that it is at least of a hundred and sixty
years' standing. After Gedde it was successively
adopted and encouraged by Rusden,
Warder, and Thorley, and has been the
fashionable or fancy practice down to the
present day; for it is a mode of managing
Bees that has been recommended by some
modern authors,&mdash;principally, if I mistake
not, by Dr. Bevan; and it is practised by
some Bee-masters, who, I am told, consider it
to be the most humane mode, and the only
humane mode of managing Honey-Bees. I
have no wish to depreciate the inventions and
labours of others, nor to offend any man, and
particularly that man who has exerted himself
so much to better the condition of the Honey-Bee.
If he has been mistaken in the means
to be employed to gain so desirable an end,
and in my humble opinion he certainly has
been mistaken, every praise is due to him for
his good intentions.</p>

<p>My first objection to the piling system is&mdash;because
it occasions a great deal of extra
trouble, labour, and inconvenience to the Bees,
and consequently prevents their collecting so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"> 137 </a></span>
great a quantity of honey and wax as they
will do where they are not subjected to these
drawbacks. And where, I would fain know,
is the humanity in increasing and obstructing
the labours of these indefatigable, little insects?
Is it not inhumanity to force them to deposit
their treasures in a garret, two or three stories
high, when a far more convenient store-room
may be provided for them on the first floor?
Let not, then, the piling advocate of the
present day any longer recommend this faulty
practice, nor erroneously contend that the
elevating of boxes one upon another, is the
best and only way of ensuring an abundance
of honey and wax. But fairly to get at the
merits&mdash;not to say&mdash;demerits of this practice,
I will examine it a little in detail. First, then,
the piling practitioner puts a swarm of Bees
into a box, which I will call box A. This
box, if prosperous, of course soon becomes a
pavilion of nature,&mdash;that is, it soon contains
quantities of brood-comb, young brood, larv,
and embryo Bees in various stages of existence.
It is allowed to stand alone until it be filled,
or nearly filled, with the Bees' works. It requires
no great skill to know that the contents
of box A. at this period are as just described.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"> 138 </a></span>
When nearly full it is placed upon another
box (B.) to prevent what is called the maiden-swarm.
This box, like box A. is quickly
filled with combs: the Queen too follows her
labourers and progressively lays her eggs even
to the lowest edges of the combs. Of course
box B, like box A. soon contains quantities of
brood. The second box (B.) gets full just as
the first did, and as a cottage-hive does&mdash;not
with pure honey, but with brood, pollen or
farina, and other substances, as well as with
honey; in short, there is no provision for, nor
means of, dividing the works of the working
Bees from the works of the Queen-Bee;
consequently they become, as <i>of necessity</i>
they must become&mdash;one promiscuous mass.
The brood continues to increase and occupies
that part of the box which should be of pure
honey and wax. This goes on until more
room is wanted; and <i>then</i> it is that the two
full boxes (A. and B.) are exalted and placed
upon the third and last box (C.) This,
however, does not mend the matter; but, as
will be seen presently, it does occasion a great
deal of additional labour and inconvenience to
the Bees. In the meantime they carry on their
works of nature and of art&mdash;they construct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"> 139 </a></span>
new combs and store some of the cells with
honey, and the Queen lays her eggs in others,
just as in the other boxes. The fact is&mdash;the
three boxes soon become as one: they soon
become and continue to be of one temperature,&mdash;the
same compound of the old hive,&mdash;the
brood-cells are intermixed with those containing
honey,&mdash;wreaths of pollen are: in every pile,&mdash;and
animated nature is everywhere peeping
from the waxen cells, in which nothing but
pure honey should have been deposited. But
this is not all, nor the worst part; though bad
enough, if <i>purity of honey</i> be any consideration.</p>

<p>It is a fact known by me and by every one
at all experienced in the management of an
apiary, that no sooner are the combs in box CL
got into a state of forwardness&mdash;it would be
saying rather too much to say&mdash;completed,
than numbers of working Bees are, as it were,
struck off their work there, and set about
removing all superfluities and nuisances from
the combs lately filled with young brood in the
uppermost box A. Every cell in those combs
that has been the nest and nursery of a young
Bee they cleanse thoroughly and repair, where
repairs are needed, preparatory to its being
made a receptacle for honey, or for the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"> 140 </a></span>
treasures brought from the field. At this
time, that is&mdash;as soon as the combs are free
from the first brood, the uppermost box is
nearly empty, instead of being full: it contains
<i>empty combs and Bees, but little or no honey</i>.
Here then the Bees are subjected to that extra
labour and inconvenience which form my first
objection to the piling-plan. From the entrance
into box C. through box B. and up into box
A. the way, to a loaded Bee, is neither short
nor pleasant; it is a labyrinth beset with
difficulties and obstructions, in surmounting
which much of that time is occupied which
would otherwise be more profitably, and we
may suppose&mdash;far more agreeably employed,
in passing from flower to flower, and in culling
their various sweets. Any person, it may be
presumed, would rather set down a heavy load
on the ground-floor than have to tug it up
two or three long flights of stairs, and through
intricate, winding passages, and be jostled
and impeded and pushed about, and perhaps
backward every now and then, by countless
crowds of busy men, unceasingly hurrying
up and down and passing and re-passing the
burdened man in every direction. And is it
not comparatively the same with Bees going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"> 141 </a></span>
through boxes C. and B. up into box A.? I
maintain that it is so,&mdash;and that Bees in
piled-boxes lose much time in performing the
unnecessary, climbing labour, imposed upon
them by their unskilful masters.</p>

<p>The natural consequence of this&mdash;I repeat&mdash;<i>unnecessary</i>
waste of their time, must not
be placed to the account, or laid to the instinct
of the Bees; for of all creatures in the world,
Bees perhaps work with the most extraordinary
celerity. The beautiful piles of honey, and
<i>when unobstructed</i>, the regular movements of
these wonderful insects, are admirably scientific
and correct. The consequence, namely, a
deficiency in the quantity of honey and wax,
is chargeable solely to the account of the
unskilful manager.</p>

<p>At length the time arrives when the three
piled-boxes are, or are supposed to be, well
stored,&mdash;and when a part of the Bees' treasure
is to be taken as a remuneration for the <i>care</i>
and trouble of the proprietor. Let him then
put on his grotesque Bee-dress, and booted up
to the middle and gloved to the very elbows,
let him proceed to take the uppermost box.
He divides it from that on which it stands,
that is&mdash;from box B. by a slide or a divider of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"> 142 </a></span>
some sort prepared for such an operation, or
in any way he pleases, for that I leave to him.
Well, he succeeds in getting off his prize;
not, however, without the destruction of a
considerable number of Bees: for <i>to presume</i>
that he is acquainted with my easy mode of
taking away a box, would be to presume too
much; I therefore allow him a Bee-dress at
once, and have accoutered him in the best way
I can for his arduous undertaking. The box,
then, is off. He turns it up and examines it,
and to his great disappointment, he finds
that the combs are discoloured, that each pile
of the expected treasure contains parts of the
young larv, and that there is much pollen
commingled with the other substances in the
box; in short, he finds that the whole is dirty
and filthy in appearance; and that he has
destroyed a part of the most valuable brood
for another year. And, if instead of box A.
he take box B. he will fare little, if any
better; nay, he will in all probability destroy
a greater quantity of brood: and in box C.
he cannot expect to find more than half-filled
cells, or empty combs. Such are the fruits
and profits of the piling system of Bee-management.
There are Bee-masters resident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"> 143 </a></span>
within twenty miles of the good town of
Spalding, and in many other places that
might be mentioned, who know that the
foregoing account is true, <i>lamentably true</i>:
but, until such practitioners are sensible of
the faultiness of their system of Bee-management,
it would be folly in me to appeal more
directly to any of them for a confirmation of
what <i>I know</i> to be the truth. How, I would
ask, can the Bees' sweet treasures be divided
from their other work, if there be no means
of varying and regulating the temperature in
their hive? Without the aid of ventilation it
is, in my opinion, impossible; but with it, it
is perfectly easy, perfectly safe, and not at all
distressing nor even unpleasant to the Bees.</p>

<p>Before I take my leave of the piling or
storifying practitioner, whom I consider, as
perhaps he may consider me, to be very, very
imperfect in the management of Bees, I feel
it to be my duty to my readers, and of course
to the piling Bee-master, if he should vouchsafe
to me a reading, to record a few other facts
that bear strongly against the piling practice&mdash;facts
derived from long and attentive observation
of the nature and habits of Honey-Bees.
Twelve years' steady practice and constant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"> 144 </a></span>
attention to the movements of these ingenious
insects are the foundations I have to build upon.
Besides I have proofs, well-authenticated, indisputable
proofs, of the abundant produce of
honey having been taken from collateral-boxes,
and that of very superior quality too; which
honey I take from the Bees as being a superabundant
store, and not as a part, the taking
away of which has any tendency to weaken,
or in any way to injure, the prosperity of the
colony from which it is taken. But what
do we behold when a box is taken from a
storied pile?&mdash;what that in the least deserves
to be termed humanity? Do not a thousand
murders stare us in the face? Why should
the operator be veiled and muffled up and
made sting-proof, if no conflict was expected&mdash;if
no deeds of violence were anticipated?
But violence is anticipated, and practised too,
to such an extent that it is no uncommon
occurrence for the Bees that escape destruction
to desert the other boxes altogether. This
ends one part of the business.</p>

<p>And these objections against the practice
of storifying boxes will, I trust, induce the
reflecting, ingenuous reader to turn his attention
to the importance of ventilation in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"> 145 </a></span>
collateral-boxes. By regulating the interior
temperature of the hive, suitable and generative
heat is confined to the pavilion, that is&mdash;to
the mother-hive, which heat causes the
Queen to propagate her young in the pavilion&mdash;this
being the middle-box, and near the
entrance, a great advantage is thereby afforded
to all the Bees passing in and out, that fully
demonstrates the necessity of their labours
being assisted in the breeding-season, <i>and not
obstructed</i>.</p>

<p>It is the heat which causes the working-Bees
to deposit their pollen in the immediate
vicinity of the seat of nature. This pollen,
which is called by some writers Bee-bread, is
gathered and deposited for the special purpose
of supporting the young larv, while helpless
insects, or babies, as it were, in the hive.
Combined with heat, it is this material which
discolours the much admired works of the
Bees; it is this which also makes the wax
and honey yellow: besides where this pollen is
deposited by the Bees, there, or in that part
of the hive, will the Queen lay her eggs,&mdash;and
there of course propagate her species.
And as animal nature advances to perfection,
so rises the interior temperature of the hive,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"> 146 </a></span>
until an almost suffocating heat obliges the
Bees to leave their home. This heat extends
itself to the most remote parts of their domicil;
and were it not for the influence of ventilation
in the end-boxes, a discolouration of their
beautiful works would also be extended through
the hive, and the Queen would lay her eggs
promiscuously as she does in the cottage-hive.
But this mischief is corrected by ventilation:
can then any reasonable man deny its powerful
and useful effects in the management of Bees?</p>

<p>The Queen-Bee is but seldom seen by the
most acute observer; she loves to propagate
her young in secrecy, at the regular temperature
of the hive at her own birth. If she can
possibly avoid it, she will not lay her eggs
where man can overlook and examine her
movements; consequently the ventilation in
the side-boxes prevents her extending her
works of nature beyond the limits of her native
hive. As soon as she feels a cooling change
of temperature, she immediately withdraws to
her native clime, and leaves her working
subjects to store the beautifully white combs
with the purest crystal sweet. Bat, were
the Queen permitted, as she is in the piling
system, as well as in the cottage-hive, to follow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"> 147 </a></span>
her subjects through the whole hive, with
one and the same temperature throughout,
she would most certainly propagate her young
just as she does in the piled-boxes. In that
case there would be no advantage derivable
from the purity of the honey. Again, on my
plan, the middle-box is so situated that the
Queen in it is placed conveniently to superintend
her labourers; her eye can behold them
in the throngest of their labour, being so near
the well fortified entrance of her pavilion. In
such a favourable situation, she can view the
movements of her subjects, and not a moment
need be lost, because all their streets and
passages are short. The direct ascent to the
top of one of my boxes is not quite eleven
inches, and with a middle-sized bell-glass
superadded, it does not exceed eighteen inches;
so that in one day, when the honey-dew is
plentiful, ten thousand Bees will gather more
treasure than three times that number on the
piling system, in which the Bees are compelled
to mount up to the Babylonian height of
Thorley's fourth box.</p>

<p>These (partly repetitions of what has been
stated before, I am aware,) are conveniences
which collateral-boxes possess, and which <i>do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"> 148 </a></span>
not belong to piled-boxes</i>. In piled-boxes Bees
are subjected to unnecessary labour, which is
so far a waste of time. From piled-boxes not
nearly the quantity of honey and wax is
procured, that may be procured from collateral-boxes,&mdash;nor
is that deficient quantity of a
quality at all comparable with the other. In
managing piled-boxes many Bees are destroyed.</p>

<p>These are my objections to that system of
Bee-management; and I put it to every person
who has practised storifying to say whether
they are not well-founded.</p>

<p class="caption3">APIARY AT DELABERE PARK.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">Having</span> stated (in <a href="#Page_144">page 144</a>) that "I have
well-authenticated, indisputable proofs of the
abundant produce of honey having been taken
from collateral-boxes, and that of very superior
quality too," I could, in support of this
statement refer the reader to a great number
of my apiarian friends, a bare catalogue of
whose names would fill several pages of this
book. But as the best proofs of the merits,
advantages, and practicability of anew system,
are in its established success, I will select one
instance, and have great pleasure in referring
to that of the apiary established on my principles,
at the seat of my noble patron&mdash;the
Marquess of Blandford, at Delabere Park, near
Reading. Situated in a part of the country
most abundantly favoured by nature,&mdash;effete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"> 151 </a></span>
with every variety of Bee-herbage, and with
every local advantage combined in its favour,
the noble Marquess has prosecuted his apiarian
pursuits with a spirit of liberality and enterprize
redounding to his credit, and well
meriting the success which has equalled my
own as it has his most sanguine expectations.
I do not consider that I can introduce this
better to the notice of my readers, than by
transcribing the account of a visit, that was
paid to it by my intelligent friend Mr. Booth,
the Lecturer on Chemistry, and which appeared
in the <i>Stamford Mercury</i> of July 26th, 1833.
It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"To the Editor of the Mercury.</p>

<p class="p0">"Sir,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:2em;">"From</span> the interest you appear to take in
whatever relates to the extension of Mr. Nutt's
invaluable system of Bee-management, and
the prompt attention you have given to former
communications on the subject, I am induced
to detail the successful results of that system
in the hands of the Marquess of Blandford, who
has gone most extensively into the subject,
and with an ardour and enthusiasm second
only to that of the intelligent inventor. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"> 152 </a></span>
I had the permission of the noble Marquess to
make my observations, so I am enabled to
make reference to his Lordship for the accuracy
of my statements, and I am only fulfilling' the
wishes of the noble Lord, in making these
details as extensively public as possible, for
the information of those who are interested in
this most important, though long neglected
branch of rural economy.</p>

<p>"His Lordship's park is most pleasantly
situated near the beautiful and romantic village
of Pangbourn, in Berkshire, and the choice
of situation for the apiary is most excellent.
It is at the top of a tower<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> forty-six feet high,
situated in the midst of a wood, and commanding
a most extensive view of the surrounding
country, including Hampshire,
Berkshire, Wiltshire, and Oxfordshire, the
face of nature being clad in an almost endless
variety of fertility, and old Father Thames
gently meandering through the valley, formed
by the distant hills which bound the scene,
affording but few prospective traces of the
immense physical developments of his powers,
which render him, truly, the monarch of rivers.
At the top of this tower his Lordship possesses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"> 153 </a></span>
four colonies in collateral-hives, and one
inverted-hive, all of which have been started
since April 1833. In the collateral-hives the
labours of the Bees have been highly successful.
From one colony has already been taken
a box containing thirty pounds of honey;
whilst another box and three small glasses,
which cannot together contain less than forty
pounds, are quite ready for taking, and which
will afford the sum of seventy pounds, and
this without infringing on the quantity necessary
for the winter support of the Bees.
The thermometer in the collateral-boxes did
not exceed 70 degrees, whilst in the air it
was at 64. A most remarkable contrast was
afforded by the superior quality of the honey
in the end-box and that of the 'pavilion of
nature:' the superiority of the former was
most evident. Mr. Smith, the keeper, who
quite follows in the steps of Mr. Nutt, informed
me that the average quantity of honey produced
from a cottage-hive, upon the old
principles, does not exceed from thirty to forty
pounds; whilst, but in one case, did he ever
obtain from a hive, enlarged by eking, the
amount of fifty pounds. It is extremely
satisfactory and fortunate, that, for the sake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"> 154 </a></span>
of reference, Mr. Nutt's system has fallen
into such good hands, as both his lordship
and the keeper appear as devoted to the
subject, as they have been happy in their
results. For young beginners the results
reflect great credit.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> Vide, plate at the head of this chapter.</p></div>

<p>"I am not able to speak much regarding
the progress of the inverted-hives, of which his
lordship possesses two; the one being at the top
of the tower and the other situate on the lawn,
at the back of the house; the former containing
twenty-three glasses and the latter thirty-three.
The latter is really a magnificent construction&mdash;an
ornamental appendage such as the gardens
of few noblemen can boast. The Bees
had, in each, filled all the intermediate parts
betwixt the hive and the glasses, and were
just then commencing their labours in the
latter. Next summer his lordship will, I
anticipate, reap a glorious harvest both from
these, and his collateral-hives, which are
getting into prime condition for the winter.</p>

<p>"I have troubled you with these details
because they relate to facts, and a publication
of such facts is all that is required to introduce
this admirable system of Bee-management
into universal practice. To what extension it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"> 155 </a></span>
may be brought, it is impossible to state, but
these results most strongly impress upon others
of the nobility to 'Go and do likewise.' The
mantle of the warrior has indeed fallen upon
the philanthropist in the person of the heir to
the title and fortunes of a Marlborough; and
let the example but be extended, and the
practice inculcated amongst our rural population,
and, whilst it will greatly conduce to
their advantage, we need no longer look to
France or Italy for a supply of treasures,
which our own country and peasantry can so
efficiently produce. Nothing could possibly
more advance these objects, than the formation
of an Apiarian Society, which should offer
premiums and prizes to the most successful
competitors; and I do hope that for the sake
of humanity as well as philanthropy, and
when I see the long and noble list of names
which dignify Mr. Nutt's patronage, I shall
not be deceived in my anticipations of the
speedy formation of a society, established for
such laudable purposes.</p>

<p>To the above very able and explicit description,
and which is to me the more interesting
because not written by a <i>practical</i> apiarian,
I have nothing to add, but that it has met the
cordial approbation of his Lordship, whose still
more recent and continuous success has confirmed
him in the practicability and value of
my system.</p>

<p>The sketch which precedes this account was
taken for the purpose by his amiable Countess,

so much of my attention has been devoted,

been amongst the least valued of my rewards
and consolations.</p>

<p class="caption3">HONEY-BEES.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">That</span> branch of natural history which treats
of INSECTS is called entomology. And
Linnus, the celebrated naturalist and botanist,
and the father of the classification of animated
and vegetable nature, has divided insects into
seven orders; the fifth of which is termed
hymenoptera, and includes all those insects
that have four membranous, gauze-like wings,
and that are furnished with a sting, or with a
process resembling one. To this class the
Honey-Bee belongs. It has, however, been
so repeatedly described by naturalists and by
apiarian authors, that it would be difficult to
say any thing respecting it as an insect merely
that has not been said before. It is, moreover,
so universally known, that it may seem to be
a superfluous undertaking to attempt to describe
it at all. As, however, my little work might
be deemed to be imperfect without some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"> 158 </a></span>
account of it, I will present to my readers the
substance of what appears to me to be a
condensed, well-written article on the Bee.
It is from Watkins' Cyclopdia.</p>

<p>There are, he says, and I believe it, fifty-five
species of Bees. The general characteristics
of the Bee are these:&mdash;its mouth has two jaws
and a proboscis enfolded in a double sheath;
its wings are four, the lower or under pair of
which is smaller than the upper pair; in the
anus of the female and working Bees is a
concealed sting. Of the fifty-five species the
HONEY-BEE&mdash;classically, or at any rate
entomologically&mdash;apis mellifica, is the most
interesting and important, and that with which
I am directly concerned. Of this Bee there
are three kinds&mdash;the Queen, the drone, and
the working Bee; it is no more than justice
to the draughtsman and to the engraver to
say, the following are beautiful representations,
except the head of the working Bee, which is
too round.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 407px;">

<p>The <i>Drones</i> are larger than the others; their
heads are round, eyes foil, and their tongues
short; they are also much darker and differ in
the form of the belly; they have no sting,
and they make a greater noise in flying than
the common Bees. Generally speaking, they
are found in hives from the beginning of May
to the middle or latter end of July: sometimes
they may be seen earlier, especially in good
stocks; and sometimes their destruction does
not take place till the middle of August, or
even later. They neither collect honey nor
wax. It has been supposed that their office
is to impregnate the eggs of the Queen <i>after</i>
they are deposited in the cells; but according
to Mr. Bonner this <i>supposition</i> is a mistake.
In this I agree with him, and beg to remark&mdash;that
in no case is a supposition a proof.
Bonner says that the Queen lays eggs which
produce young Bees without any communication
with the drones. He supports this position
by the statement of several very exact experiments.
In this opinion he is supported by
the respectable evidence of Schirach. On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"> 160 </a></span>
mysterious subject of the Queen's impregnation
I am inclined to coincide in opinion with
Huber, whose multiplied observations, and
various and curious experiments, do render it
highly probable that the Queen is impregnated
by the drone, not whilst in the hive, but
whilst flying in the air: but of this debatable
subject more by and by.</p>

<p>The QUEEN-BEE is easily distinguished
from other Bees by the form, size, and colour
of her body. She is larger, longer at least,
and her wings are shorter in proportion to
her size than those of other Bees. The wings
of drones and of common working Bees cover
their bodies, but those of the Queen scarcely
reach beyond the middle. Her hinder part
tapers more than the corresponding part of
other Bees, and is admirably adapted for the
purpose of being introduced into the cells to
deposit her eggs, which she does without
being incommoded by her wings, as she no
doubt would be, were they long in proportion
to the length of her body. Considering then
the office she has to perform, the shortness of
her wings and the length and tapering of her
body are alike conveniences to her; her belly
and legs are yellower, and her upper parts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"> 161 </a></span>
darker than those of other Bees. Though
furnished with a sting, she very rarely uses it,
and will bear being handled without being
provoked. A young Queen is smaller than a
full grown one. When three or four days old
she is quick in her motions; but when impregnated
she becomes heavy. The common
or working Bees have the faculty or instinctive
power of raising a Queen-Bee, when they are
in want of one, from an egg in a common cell.
To do this, they choose a common cell in
which is an egg, and inject a thick, white,
liquid matter from their proboscis, they then
build on the edges of that particular cell and
enlarge it; on the fifth day the royal maggot
appears in the form of a semicircle, in which
form it swims in the midst of the matter in
the cell; and on the seventh day it is sealed
up. During which period the embryo Queen
undergoes various metamorphoses. On the
fourteenth or fifteenth day afterwards it comes
forth a perfect Queen-Bee. Schirach has
discovered a method of multiplying Queen-Bees
to almost any extent, and consequently
of making artificial stocks. This can only be
successfully accomplished when there are in a
hive eggs, nymphs, and little maggots two or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"> 162 </a></span>
three days out of the cell, that is, when there
is in a hive young brood in these three different
stages of existence. When a Queen dies and
the Bees are left without the means of raising
another, that is&mdash;when there are no eggs nor
young brood of a proper age in the hive, the
Bees cease working, consume the honey, fly
about at random, and if not supplied with
another Queen, soon dwindle away; but if
supplied with a new Queen, they revive, and
exercise their labour with new and increased
activity. The Queen is, as it were, the very
soul of the hive. It has been computed that
the ovary of the Queen contains above 5000
eggs at once, and that in the space of two
months she may produce 10 or 12,000 Bees.
I am inclined to think that this computation
is too-limited: from what I have witnessed in
my observatory-hive this summer (1832), I am
led to conclude that a fertile Queen is capable
of laying far more than the beforementioned
number of eggs in the space of two months.</p>

<p>The <i>working Bees</i> are considerably smaller
than either the drones or the Queen. They,
like the others, have four wings, which enable
them to fly with heavy loads. They have six
legs, of which the two foremost are the shortest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"> 163 </a></span>
and with these they discharge themselves of
their loads. The two last or hindmost are
the largest, and on the outside of the middle
joint of these is a cavity in which the Bees
collect the materials for wax, which materials
they carry home to their hives; this hollow is
peculiar to the working Bee. Each foot terminates
in two hooks. The honey-bladder is
of the size of a small pea, and very transparent.
The sting is horny and hollow, through which
the poison is ejected. The wound inflicted by
it is mortal to many insects; and instances
are not wanting of horses and cows having
been stung to death by Bees. When the
sting is left in the wound, and being barbed
it commonly is left there, the Bee that loses
it dies in consequence.</p>

<p>With regard to the age of Bees, the drones
have a short life, being destroyed annually by
the working Bees; these&mdash;the workers&mdash;are
supposed by some to live but one year, but
others are of opinion that they live several
years: those of them that escape a premature
death will live, if I mistake not, three or four
years, or even longer. I once clipped one of
the wings of a Queen so that I could identify
her, in case I should ever meet with her again:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"> 164 </a></span>
I then returned her to her hive, and had the
good fortune to see her several times afterwards
during three successive years. Of course she
lived more than three years. What became
of her at last I do not know; nor whether she
may not still survive I do not know. If,
however, working Bees be as long-lived as
Queen-Bees, and I think it will be difficult
to assign a good reason why they should not,
they may live to be three or four years of age,
and perhaps more than that. The ample
provision they make for life seems to me to be
a <i>natural</i> indication that they expect at least
to live to have occasion for it. Sometimes
fierce, destructive battles take place between
the Bees of different hives in an apiary, and
when the Queen of one hive is killed, the
war ceases, and the surviving Bees of the
two hives unite and become one peaceable
stock.</p>

<p>Some apiarians have obtained an extraordinary
command over Bees, particularly
Mr. Wildman, who could entice a whole
swarm to settle just where he pleased&mdash;on his
chin, on his head, on his hand, or on any
particular branch of a tree; but these feats, so
surprising to the beholders, he effected, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"> 165 </a></span>
any other dexterous person may, by getting
possession of the Queen-Bee, and placing her
where he intended the Bees should settle; for
it is a well-ascertained fact, that such is the
attachment of Bees to their Queen, that they
will congregate around her, and, as far as
they can, protect her in whatever situation
they find her. Were the attachment and
<i>allegiance</i> of all subjects to their legitimate
sovereigns thus true and powerful, it would,
as Sterne says, be something!</p>

<p>In working the Bees are said by some, whose
sayings are perhaps more fanciful than correct,
in the following instance at least;&mdash;it has,
however, been <i>said</i>&mdash;that in working the Bees
form themselves into four companies, one of
which roves the fields in search of materials
for the hive, another is employed in laying
out the bottoms and partitions of the cells, the
third in smoothing the inside from the corners
and angles, and the fourth in bringing food
for the rest. According to this account some
are labourers, others are builders, others finishers,
and others purveyors. As there is no
difference in the formation of the workers, I
see no reason for assigning them any particular
task or sort of work, nor do I think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"> 166 </a></span>
the allotment of labour just mentioned rests
upon any other foundation than that of vague
conjecture. Their diligence, however, and
activity, are so great, that in a favourable day
they will make cells which lie on each other,
sufficient to contain some thousands of Bees.
To keep their habitations&mdash;their hives, close
and tight, they make use of a resinous gum,
which the ancients called, and which is still
called&mdash;<i>propolis</i>. This substance is at first
soft and pliable, but becomes firmer every day;
when it has acquired its proper consistency, it
is harder than wax and is an excellent cement.
They guard against the entrance of ants and
other inimical insects into their hive, by gluing
or filling up with this propolis the smallest
inlets; and with it they fasten the edge of
their hive to its floor in a very secure manner.
Some Bees stand as sentinels, and mount
guard, as it were, to prevent the intrusion of
strangers and enemies. But if a snail, or
other reptile, or any large insect, forces its way
into the hive, they first kill it, and then coat
it over with propolis, to prevent being annoyed
by the noisome smell, or by the maggots
which might proceed from its putrefaction, if
left to putrefy. Bees can perceive the approach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"> 167 </a></span>
of bad weather; for when black clouds are in
the sky indicating rain, they immediately
hurry home with the greatest speed; and when
to the eye of man there is no visible token of
a sudden shower or other immediate change
from fine weather to foul, Bees are aware of
it, and by their sudden, hurried return to their
hives, are the first to prognosticate a change
as near; nor, often as I have observed them,
have I ever found them wrong in this respect.
The manner in which Bees rest when they
settle, after having swarmed, and frequently
in the hive also, is by collecting themselves
into a cluster and hanging to each other by the
hooks of their feet. When the weather has been
warm I have frequently seen them, presently
after being admitted into an end-box, hang in
catkins or ropes: this they no doubt do to
cool themselves the more. To view the Bees
suspended from one another in these single
ropes is a natural curiosity well worth attention.
The flight of Bees when swarming is singularly
rapid and most extraordinary: during some
minutes after having risen into the air, they
dart across each other in every conceivable
direction, wheel round and shoot through the
merry crowd again, again wheel round and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"> 168 </a></span>
again dart through; and notwithstanding
the very limited space within which they
confine their gambols on these occasions, they
never seem to come in contact or to clash with
each other; though animated and excited to
a degree of apparently frantic ovation, I never
have observed one Bee fall foul of another,
and this it is that strikes me as being wonderful.
The balls attached to the legs of Bees
returning to the hives, consist of a powder
gathered from the stamina of flowers, not yet
brought to the state of wax. The Bee, when
it enters the cup of the flower, rolls itself till
its whole body is covered with the yellow
farina that is therein. It then brushes off
this powdery farina with its hind legs, and
kneads it into two balls or small pellets,
loaded with which it returns to the hive. Bees
powdered all over with farina may frequently
be seen entering their hive: the Bees thus
covered carry their loads upon their whole
bodies, without the labour of packing them
upon their thighs. Probably when farina is
collected in the immediate vicinity of their
hives, Bees may have the wisdom (I know not
what else it can be properly called) to save
themselves the labour of brushing and making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"> 169 </a></span>
it into pellets. Some authors hold that this
substance is eaten by degrees, and being
digested in the body of the Bee, that it
becomes wax,&mdash;or that by some peculiar process
it certainly is converted into wax,&mdash;and
that when there is a superfluous quantity of
this undigested, or unmanufactured matter, it
is laid up in store, and is called <i>Bee-bread</i>.
For my part I am of opinion that farina is
stored up purely as Bee-bread and food for
the young brood, and that <i>it enters not into
the composition of wax</i>. The material of
which wax is formed I take to be quite distinct
from farina&mdash;a material of a different nature.</p>

<p>The following account of a working Bee
appeared in the Farmers' Journal some time
ago, I subjoin it, because, in some respects, it
is more particular than that just given; but
in one thing it is deficient&mdash;it makes no
mention of the eyes&mdash;the two luminaries or
lights of the body. The eyes of Bees are of
an oblong figure, black like jet, transparent
and immoveable.</p>

<p>BEE, says the Farmers' Journal, a small
and well-known insect, famous for its industry.
This useful and laborious insect is divided by
two ligaments into three parts or portions,&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"> 170 </a></span>
head, the breast, and the belly. The head
is armed with two jaws and a trunk, the
former of which play like two jaws, opening
and shutting to the right and left; the trunk
is long and tapering, and at the same time
extremely pliant and flexible, being destined
by nature for the insect to probe to the bottom
of the flowers, through all the impediments of
their chives and foliage, and drain them of
their treasured sweets: but were this trunk to
be always extended, it would prove incommodious,
and be liable to be injured by a thousand
accidents; it is therefore of such a structure,
that after the performance of its necessary
functions, it may be contracted, or rather
folded up; and besides this, it is fortified
against all injuries by four strong scales, two
of which closely sheath it, and the two others,
whose cavities and dimensions are larger,
encompass the whole. From the middle-part
or breast of the Bee grow the legs, which are
six in number; and at the extremity of the
paws are two little hooks, discernible by the
microscope, which appear like sickles, with
their points opposite to each other.</p>

<p>The wings are four, two greater and two
smaller, which not only serve to transport
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"> 171 </a></span>
them through the air, but, by the noise they
make, to give notice of their departure and
arrival, and to animate them mutually to
their labours. The hairs, with which the
whole body is covered, are of singular use in
retaining the small dust that falls from the
chives of the flowers. The belly of the Bee
consists of six rings, which slide over one
another, and may therefore be lengthened or
contracted at pleasure; and the inside of this
part of the body contains the intestines,&mdash;the
bag of honey,&mdash;the bag of poison,&mdash;and the
sting. The office of the intestines is the same
as in other animals. The bag of honey is
transparent as crystal, containing the sweet
juices extracted from the flowers, which the
Bee discharges into the cells of the magazine
for the support of the community in w inter.</p>

<p>The bag of poison hangs at the root of the
sting, through the cavity of which, as through
a pipe, the Bee ejects some drops of this
venomous liquor into the wound made by the
sting, and so renders the pain more excessive.
The mechanism of the sting is admirable,
being composed of two darts, inclosed within
a sheath that tapers into a fine point, near
which is an opening to let out the poison;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"> 172 </a></span>
the two darts are ejected through another
aperture, which being armed with several sharp
beards, like those of fish-hooks, are not easily
drawn back again by the Bee; and indeed
she never disengages them if the wounded
party happens to start and put her in confusion;
but if, when stung, one can have patience to
continue calm and unmoved, the stinging Bee
clinches those lateral points round the shaft
of the dart, by which means she recovers her
weapon, and gives less pain to the person stung.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="CHAPTER_XIa" id="CHAPTER_XIa"></a>FOR THE STING OF A BEE.</p>

<p>The poisonous liquor which the stinging Bee
infuses into the wound causes a fermentation,
attended with a swelling, which continues
sometimes several days; but that may be
prevented by immediately pulling out the
sting, and enlarging the puncture, to let the
venomous matter have room to escape.</p>

<p>Many nostrums have been recommended as
cures&mdash;<i>infallible cures</i>, of course&mdash;for the sting
of a Bee, a few of which I will just mention;
premising, however, that I myself never make
use of any of them; for, if by chance a Bee
happens to sting me, which is very rarely
indeed the case, though I never so much as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"> 173 </a></span>
cover my face, nor even put on a pair of gloves,
when operating among thousands and tens of
thousands of Bees, I extract the sting instanter,
and never afterwards experience the least pain,
nor suffer the slightest inconvenience. But,
if the sting be suffered to remain in the flesh,
during a few seconds only, it is not very easy
to stop the inflammation and to allay the pain.
An onion cut horizontally into thin slices, and
pressed closely to the wounded part, and
renewed at short intervals, has been accounted
a good application. If the part stung be first
well-rubbed with one of those slices, that would
perhaps have a soothing effect. The juice of
the plantain is also said to be a specific; olive
oil is another; so is common salt; so is laudanum;
so is spirits of hartshorn; so is a solution
of sal ammoniac; and so is chalk or whitening.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Doctor</span> (and who so likely to prescribe
properly for the case as the Doctor?) says<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>
"common whitening proves an effectual remedy
against the effects of the sting of a Bee
or wasp. The whitening is to be moistened
with cold water, and immediately applied.
It may be washed off in a few minutes, when
neither pain nor swelling will ensue."</p>

<p>In "The Apiarian's Guide, by J. H. Payne,"
published since the first edition of this work,
I find the following novel mode of treatment
recommended as "almost a perfect cure," and
which is said to be "as immediate as it is effectual."
"The method I (J. H. Payne, Esq.)
have of late adopted, by which the pain is
instantly removed, and both the swelling and
inflammation prevented, is to pull out the
sting as soon as possible, and take a piece of
iron and heat it in the fire, or for want of that,
take a live coal, (if of wood the better, because
it lasts longer) and hold it as near to the place
as I can possibly endure it, for five minutes;
if from this application a sensation of heart
(quere heat) should be occasioned, a little oil of
turpentine or goulard cerate must be applied.</p>

<p>"I have found the quicker the application,
the more effectual the cure."<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> See the Apiarian's Guide, pp. 58, 59.</p></div>

<p>Pressure with the hollowed end of a small
key, or with a pencil-case, is practised by
some unfortunates, and is said to check the
circulation of the poison.</p>

<p>This last mode of treatment&mdash;i. e. pressure
with a small key, or pencil-case&mdash;the smaller
the better&mdash;is the simplest, and, if <i>immediately</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"> 175 </a></span>
adopted, is I believe the very best: but its
efficacy depends upon the instant application
of the key or pencil-case to the part stung,
by which the poisonous matter is not only
prevented from being absorbed into the system,
but the puncture is laid open, and the virus
thereby expressed and entirely got rid of more
readily than by any other means.</p>

<p>Accidents may sometimes happen, and the
most cautious and humane apiarian may occasionally
receive a sting; but gentle treatment
does not irritate Bees; and when not irritated
they have no disposition to use their stings.</p>

<p class="caption3">IMPREGNATION OF THE QUEEN-BEE.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">Notwithstanding</span> the most persevering
attention of Huber and of other ingenious
apiarians, and notwithstanding the experiments
and expedients had recourse to, to discover the
secret, it is still doubtful&mdash;it is still undiscovered,
in what precise way the Queen-Bee
becomes impregnated. No one has ever yet
witnessed the fact of her copulation with a
drone, either in the hive or elsewhere,&mdash;in
all probability no one ever will be witness to it;
consequently the contradictory conclusions
apiarians have come to on this subject are
unsatisfactory, because unsupported by sufficient
and convincing proofs. Huber, after
having made a variety of observations and
tried numberless experiments to get at the fact,
gives it as his opinion&mdash;that the impregnation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"> 177 </a></span>
of the Queen is accomplished by her intercourse
with the drone during a flight in the open
atmosphere; but modestly states that he never
witnessed the act of copulation. On this last
point I entirely coincide with him, and firmly
believe that no man ever yet has been present
to confirm the supposed fact; neither can any
person deny the possibility&mdash;not to say&mdash;the
probability of such an union. On the other
hand, Mr. Huish is an advocate for the drones
in another way, stating them to be the male
Bees, and that they fecundate&mdash;<i>not the Queen</i>,
but all the eggs of the Queen, produced by
her, the year in which the drones are brought
into existence. But Mr. Huish has nowhere
stated, in his much admired treatise on Bees,
what fecundates those eggs of the Queen
which are produced by her in the absence of
the drones. It is well-known that those eggs
do well and come to perfection, long after the
drones have ceased to exist in the hive. <i>Eggs
are laid and matured into Bees when there is
not one drone in the hive.</i> This, therefore, is
an argument in favour of Mr. Huber's opinion&mdash;namely&mdash;that
the Queen once impregnated
remains so during her life,&mdash;and that, as the
Queen lives some years, the drones are called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"> 178 </a></span>
into being to fecundate the young Queens,
brought into existence for purposes that will
be noticed in the next chapter. Neither
should we overlook the singular services of the
short-lived drones in other circumstances of
the colony; for most essential is their presence
in the hive during the months of May, June,
and July. Do we not in those months behold
the extraordinary rapidity with which the
working Bees leave their hive in search of
materials for their various works? So indefatigable
are these admired insects, after
enriching their commonwealth, that in the
time of honey-dews, scarcely a mechanical
labourer is left in the hive. Now, were it not
for the drones&mdash;those large bodied Bees&mdash;what
would become of the young larv then in
existence? It would undoubtedly perish. No
sooner, however, is this busy season at an end,
than the total destruction of the drones takes
place; but not until the animal heat which
the drones impart to the hive has accelerated
the production of the young Bees, and added
thousands of them to the mother hive.</p>

<p>It is not possible that the drones can influence
the impregnation of the Queen's eggs,
particularly those eggs which are produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"> 179 </a></span>
after the total destruction of the drones, which
generally takes place in August, and sometimes
in the latter end of July. These later eggs are
hatched, and brought to a state of perfection
by the crowded population of the hive at
that period: for a sufficient number of common
Bees, that is&mdash;a well-populated hive, will
always bring to perfection the Queen's eggs
that have been deposited in the cells, after the
total destruction of the drones. This seems
to prove, that there is some probable truth in
Huber's opinion respecting the agency of the
drones in the procreation of Bees, by their
sexual union with the Queen. Though I was
once inclined to differ in opinion with Huber
on this subject, and even went so far as to
venture to say with Huish, and in Huish's own
words&mdash;that the Queen knows not coition, and
that she is both virgin and mother,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> from
what I have seen in my observatory-hive this
summer (1832) I am led to doubt the accuracy
of that remark, and am disposed to lean
to Huber's doctrine, and to think, that there
<i>may be</i> more truth in his experiments than
has hitherto been awarded to them: in short,
I see no objection to Huber's theory, although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"> 180 </a></span>
there is no direct proof of the copulation of
the Queens with the drones. All apiarians
allow that there are male and female in a
hive or stock of Bees;&mdash;all admit&mdash;indeed, it
is impossible to deny&mdash;-that Bees <i>do increase
and multiply</i> at a prodigious rate, and so
fulfil the Divine injunction; the only question
to be solved is this&mdash;<i>How</i> is the Queen-Bee
impregnated? This secret in nature&mdash;if those
matters, or natural operations which we cannot
clearly explain, which, though in themselves
sensible and gross, may, nevertheless, be too
subtile, too refined, for our obtuse understandings
to comprehend, and for our dull faculties
to investigate,&mdash;if these may be called secrets
in nature, there is a secret of this description
respecting the sexual union of Queen and
drone Bees, or, at any rate, respecting the
manner of the impregnation of the Queen-Bee.
I condemn no man who differs from
me on this nice subject, as I have no direct
proof, either that Huber is right, or that
Huish is wrong, in their surmises relative to
this disputable matter. Individually they are
men deserving the highest respect; their
labours and perseverance to throw light upon
this mystic branch of apiarian science deserve
the utmost praise; as also do the labours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"> 181 </a></span>
of the learned and ingenious Dr. Bevan,
whose treatise on Bees I have read with much
pleasure; and have occasionally referred to,
and shall again make use of it, in this my
humble attempt. We have all exerted our
best abilities to become the favourites of our
patrons and friends. How much each of us
deserves the honours conferred on us, is best
known to those who have been most benefited
by our unceasing endeavours to improve and
extend apiarian science. My great object
is&mdash;not to dispute with the naturalist, the
philosopher, or with the apiarian, <i>how</i> the
Queen-Bee becomes impregnated: because, be
that as it may, it is, no doubt, consistent with
the law of nature,&mdash;it is, no doubt, a part of
that all-prevailing law; and though hitherto
undiscovered,&mdash;hitherto "one of nature's
gambols with the human mind," I do cherish
strong hopes that the observatory-hive I have
constructed, will on some auspicious, future
day, disclose such facts as will set the matter
at rest for ever: my great object at present is&mdash;to
endeavour to improve the culture of Honey-Bees,
and to lay before my readers <i>practical</i>
instructions for the more humane, and more
profitable management of those interesting,
little insects.</p>

a foreigner, <i>experienced</i> beyond most other

our reckoning was incorrect, and even
making merry with the old man's infirmities.
Perplexed, and doubting in whom it is most

every corner of which we are thoroughly

<p>There is but one reigning Queen in a colony
of Bees at one time: but previously to swarming,
royal-cells are constructed, and provision
made, for ensuring a successor to the Queen
that leads the swarm and emigrates, when the
too-crowded population, and over-heated temperature
of the hive, render such emigration
necessary. That it is the old Queen that
leaves the hive with a swarm I am well convinced,
notwithstanding what some apiarians
assert to the contrary. To satisfy myself on
this point, I have sometimes in the evening of
the day on which a hive has swarmed, at other
times on the second, and at others on the
third day after that event, put the parent-stock
under, or rather, I may say&mdash;<i>over</i> fumigation,
dissected and examined the combs and Queen-cells
minutely, and the Bees also, and whenever
I did find a Queen, she was invariably a
young one; but, instead of a Queen, I have
more frequently found a royal-cell just ready
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"> 184 </a></span>
to give birth, as it were, to a successor to that
that had left the hive; and in general there
are several of these royal-cells containing
embryo Queens, in different states of forwardness:
so that it seems, Bees have an instinctive
foresight which leads them to provide against
casualties, for they are generally provided with
the means of bringing forth <i>supernumerary
Queens</i>, that in case the first that comes forth
should prove steril, should be defective, or in
any way unfortunate, or unfitted to assume
the sovereignty of the hive, there may be
others ready to burst into being, and remedy
the misfortune that would ensue, were there
but one chance of a successor, and were that
one chance to prove abortive. But no sooner
is a young Queen enthroned, as it were, and
established in the government of the hive than
the supernumerary ones, in whatever stage of
existence, are all discarded, and cast out of
the colony, Mr. Porter, of Cowbit, has this
year (1832) picked up eight of those discarded,
virgin Queens, together with the old Queen,
which last was sorely mutilated, <i>but not killed</i>&mdash;she
alone was cast out alive, the others had
been killed: these nine supernumerary Queens
were all cast out of one fine colony of Bees in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"> 185 </a></span>
the course of two successive days. That
colony is a remarkably prosperous one, <i>and
has not swarmed</i>. I myself have observed no
fewer than twenty-four supernumerary, virgin
Queens that were cast out of one of my stocks;
and that stock is flourishing, and <i>has not
swarmed:</i> and my respected friend, Mr. Salmon,
of Stokeferry, informs me that he once collected
upwards of thirty of these young Queens;
whether his stock swarmed or not I am unable
to state positively, but presume it did not;
for, generally speaking, when supernumerary,
virgin Queens are cast out of a colony, it may
be considered as an indication that that colony
is not only prosperous, but that swarming is
not contemplated&mdash;in fact, is abandoned for
that season. The question then is&mdash;how are
Bees to be managed, in order that they may
be induced to rid themselves of these supernumeraries?
The relation of the following
practical lesson will both answer the question,
and exemplify and confirm the foregoing
remarks.</p>

<p>It has already been related (in <a href="#Page_62">pages 62-66</a>)
that in 1826 I forced a colony of Bees
to swarm,&mdash;that I returned that swarm to its
parent-stock, and managed so as to prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"> 186 </a></span>
its swarming in future,&mdash;and that two royal
nymphs were cast out on that occasion. To
prove whether I could not accomplish the same
object, and prevent swarming altogether, I had
recourse to the following experiment.</p>

<p>On the 26th of June, 1827, at one o'clock
p.m. the thermometer, in one of my colonies of
Bees, suddenly rose to 96. The progressive rise
and constantly high temperature in that colony,
during the evening and night, together with
the extraordinary weight of the hive, induced
me to suspect that swarming, if not prevented,
would shortly take place. Not, however,
perceiving any of the symptoms that usually
precede the immediate act of swarming, I
suffered matters to go on until the 6th of July,
on which day the thermometer stood at 102.
The drones came out and sung their merry
tune; and during the whole night the temperature
of the colony continued to increase.
On the next day unequivocal symptoms of
swarming presented themselves. These urged
me to push my experiment to the highest pitch
of proof; I therefore went on narrowly watching
and ventilating this stock, until the 10th of
July, when, in spite of my endeavours to keep
down the temperature by <i>merely ventilating</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"> 187 </a></span>
the thermometer was standing at 112, consequently
I concluded that it was high time to
lay this prosperous colony under contribution;
and in the evening of that day, I took from it
a beautifully finished glass of honey, as pure
as the crystal stream; its weight was sixteen
pounds. I continued ventilating the side-boxes,
and placed an empty bell-glass upon
the middle one, from which I had just before
taken the full one, I then withdrew the dividing-slide,
and the Bees immediately entered the
glass, and began their works in it, and in
four days filled it with comb, and partly
filled the cells with honey. On the sixth day
after those operations had been performed, a
continuance of the former temperature demonstrated
to me the necessity of taking away a
side-box. I did so, and found its weight to
be no less than sixty-five pounds. On removing
the box of honey, I replaced it with an
empty one; and on drawing up the tin-slide,
in order to admit the Bees into the empty
box, to my great gratification I found the
thermometer standing at 82 in that box,
and in the space of five minutes the other
collateral-box was under the same agreeable
temperature. By this continued ventilation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"> 188 </a></span>
within the short space of twenty-four hours
afterwards, I ascertained the following important
fact,&mdash;viz.&mdash;that no sooner did the
Queen-Bee feel the agreeable change that had
taken place in the interior of her domicil,
than the royal nymph was dislodged from its
cell, and by the Bees brought out of the
pavilion, and laid lifeless on the front-board.</p>

<p>This fact taught me by experiment, that the
reigning Queen would very soon, from real
necessity, have been compelled to leave the
now discarded nymph to take possession of
the hive.</p>

<p>The Queen, owing to the excessive and
daily increasing heat of the hive, would have
left her wealthy colony&mdash;would have been
compelled to leave it&mdash;had not the ventilation,
and the enlargement of her domicil, prevented
the painful necessity of her so doing. This,
I think, proves the truth of the observation&mdash;that
it is the old Queen which leaves, when
Bees are compelled to swarm; but, if not, the
following experimental operations have demonstrated
the fact. I have united many swarms,
and every sovereign Bee I have been under the
necessity of making a captive, has invariably
been an old one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"> 189 </a></span></p>

<p>On the 25th of June, 1828, I took up a
parent-stock, four days after it had thrown
off a swarm, and there found only the royal
nymph within its cradle&mdash;<i>there was no Queen
left in that stock, save the one in embryo</i>&mdash;the
old Queen had gone with the swarm. This
lesson caused me to carry my experiments
farther. Having taken up the parent-stock,
as just stated, I united all the working Bees
of that stock to those of the swarm already
mentioned, and I also put the young larv
found in the parent-stock, to the now united-stock;
I then placed the intended royal
species&mdash;the nymph already mentioned&mdash;with
the remainder of the young brood, in one of
the collateral-boxes, and immediately let the
odour of the stock through the communicating
slide. To my great satisfaction I discovered
the willingness of the old Bees to bring to
perfection the young they had been compelled
to leave in their former domicil. The royal
nymph, however, was an exception; she alone
was instantly dragged from her cell, and cast
out of the hive.</p>

<p>This confirmed the proof of the important
fact gained the preceding year,&mdash;namely&mdash;that
ventilation and the means of dividing
the treasures of the Bees, by taking off a glass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"> 190 </a></span>
or a box of honey,&mdash;or, if necessary, by taking
off both a glass and a box, set aside the
necessity for swarming. On all occasions,
under this practice, a proper temperature may
be supported in a colony; and in all critical
points, by a just observation of the state of
the thermometer, Bees may be relieved and
assisted, and all the mischiefs attending the
old mode of management may be guarded
against and prevented. For when adequately
relieved and properly assisted, they proceed
to rid the colony of all embryo Queens, which
would only become so many supernumeraries
in a hive where the reigning Queen is fertile,
and the necessity for emigration is superseded.
But, unless Bees could be made to understand
that accommodation will be extended to them
at the proper time, they, guided by <i>their</i> sense
of their situation&mdash;not by ours&mdash;naturally and
wisely provide <i>their own means</i> of relieving
themselves; and in so doing frequently bring
forth what afterwards become supernumerary
Queens, which are invariably destroyed and
cast out of the colony, as soon as the Bees
are sensible that they have no occasion for
them. And, whenever a royal nymph or a
virgin Queen is thus cast out, swarming need
not be apprehended.</p>

<p class="caption3">BEE-FEEDING.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">Neglected</span> generally, as is the management
of Bees by their cottage possessors, there is
no part of it less attended to, nor more slovenly
performed, when performed at all, than that
of feeding. The cottager commonly takes up,
as he terms it, his best hives for the sake of
the treasures they contain, or are supposed to
contain. This is destroying Bees because
they are rich! He also takes up the lightest
and poorest&mdash;of course the late swarms&mdash;and
those that are the least likely to live through
the winter; because if he get from one of these
but two or three pounds of honey, though he
seldom gets so much, and a few ounces of wax,
he thinks that that is all clear gain: and, if
he get neither honey nor wax, he, at any rate,
gets rid of the <i>expense</i> and <i>trouble</i> of feeding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"> 192 </a></span>
<i>his good-for-nothing swarms</i>, which, in his
opinion, however fed, would never come to
any good. A pennyworth of brimstone will
do the job at once, and is more easily paid for
than a pound of sugar, and after that another,
and perhaps another. Such is the reasoning,
and calculation, and cruel practice of the
generality of cottage Bee-keepers! Such is
the destruction annually dealt out to hundreds
of poor swarms, and thousands and
millions of <i>poor</i> Bees!! I do from my heart
pity and deplore the untimely fate of these
suffocated, innocent, valuable insects. To
destroy Bees because they are rich is a
<i>barbarous</i> practice, and ought by all means
to be discountenanced and discontinued;&mdash;to
destroy Bees because they are poor and may
need support, is cruel&mdash;-is inhuman&mdash;is shocking,
however little may be thought of it by
those who still adhere to this practice. Even
with the common straw-hives, this terrible
havoc among poor stocks and late swarms
might be prevented, if they, who happen to
have them, would so far improve themselves
in the practical management of an apiary, as
to be able to fumigate, and to take such Bees
out of the hives containing them, and to join
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"> 193 </a></span>
them to their richer stock-hives, in the latter
end of August, or any time in September.
This is by far the best plan that can be adopted
with poor hives; and there really is no difficulty
in the operation. This strengthens the
population of rich stocks, and causes them to
swarm early in the ensuing spring, <i>it preserves
the Bees</i>, which is of itself, independently of
the advantages accruing from it afterwards,
a consideration that never should be lost sight
of,&mdash;it leaves the contents of the fumigated
hive, as absolutely in the possession of the
Bee-owner, as if the Bees had been suffocated
and destroyed,&mdash;and in most cases it entirely
does away with the necessity of feeding. I
confess I should rejoice greatly, and flatter
myself that every friend of humanity would
rejoice with me, to see this mode of disposing
of weak hives universally adopted; because,
it may be presumed, that the next step in the
way of improvement would be to take away
the superabundant treasure of the Bees and
<i>still preserve them</i>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, under certain circumstances
it will always be necessary, and judicious
in Bee-masters, to have recourse to <i>feeding</i>.
If, for instance, after an early swarm is put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"> 194 </a></span>
into a hive, or into a box, two or three or more
cold, ungenial days should follow, and more
particularly if those days should happen to be
rainy also, by feeding such a swarm you will
assist your impoverished labourers, not only
with <i>necessary food</i>, but with materials and
treasure, which, unfortunately for them, they
cannot at such an unfavourable juncture get
abroad to collect elsewhere.</p>

<p>Different apiarians have adopted and recommended
different ways of feeding Bees, none
of which, in my opinion, possess any great
merit; in order, therefore, to improve this part
of Bee-management, my endeavours have been
directed to the contrivance and construction
of a feeding department; which is attached
to my collateral-hives in so convenient a
manner, that I can feed my Bees, at any time
when feeding is required&mdash;in spring, in autumn,
or in winter, without disturbing the position
of the hive, and without changing its interior
temperature; which temperature cannot be
kept equable and comfortable, where a hive
is frequently lifted up from its stand, and its
interior is suddenly exposed to the action
of perhaps an extremely cold atmosphere.
Besides, a hive cannot be lifted up without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"> 195 </a></span>
breaking the propolis by which it has been
cemented all round and made fast to its stool.
In sharp, cold weather, disruption of the hive
from its stool is a serious mischief done to the
Bees; because, however carefully it maybe
set down again, there will have been made
many vents and crevices between the edge of
the hive and the stool, which will occasion
various currents of air, cold, frosty, or other&mdash;proper
or improper&mdash;to be continually passing
through the lower part of the hive. And
should Bees be tempted by food, or urged by
hunger, to descend into these currents in
sharp, frosty weather, but few of them will
get away alive; the keen air acting upon
them whilst feeding, paralyzes and kills them.
I am an advocate for keeping Bees cool in
winter&mdash;yes, <i>cool and still also:</i> let them
not be disturbed nor disunited,&mdash;let them not
be forced nor tempted to (if I may so say)
uncluster themselves. I have no objection to
a current of air passing through the lower
part of a hive in winter, <i>provided the Bees be
not disturbed&mdash;be not exposed singly to its
nipping influence;</i> but I strongly object to the
feeding of Bees in such currents, because, in
that case, feeding is prejudicial to them. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"> 196 </a></span>
cottager seldom protects his hives in winter
with any other covering than that which a
pot, called a pancheon, whelmed over each
hive, forms; capped with this unsightly piece
of earthenware, his hives are exposed to all
weathers; consequently the less he disturbs
them the better. He therefore should give
his weak stocks <i>a copious feeding</i>, in September
at the latest,&mdash;not molest them during the
severity of winter,&mdash;but in the spring, as soon
as the Bees begin to make their appearance at
the mouth of his hives, introduce his wooden
trough furnished with a <i>little</i> Bee-sirup, and
then close up the entrance,&mdash;withdraw the
trough in the morning, and return it replenished
every evening, as long as feeding is necessary.
Tearing off a hive at Christmas, and scattering
a few ounces of brown sugar upon
the stand, and then setting down the hive
again, deserves not the name of feeding;
though it is all the bounty that is bestowed
on some stocks; and is even more than others
are treated with. It need not then be wondered
at that so many stocks of Bees perish in the
winter, and in the spring of every year. <i>By
judicious feeding, at proper seasons, almost
any stock of Bees may be preserved: by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"> 197 </a></span>
injudicious feeding</i>, at an improper season,
even good stocks&mdash;stocks that would survive,
if not fed at all, nor molested, during the
depth and severity of winter, may be seriously
injured&mdash;may be totally destroyed. The
peasant Bee-keeper, however, does not often
subject himself to the charge <i>complimental</i>
of being accessary to the death of his Bees
<i>through mistaken kindness</i>.</p>

<p>The sum and substance of my directions, as
respects Bee-feeding, are these:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. In spring feed <i>sparingly</i>.</p>

<p>2. In autumn feed <i>plentifully</i>.</p>

<p>3. In winter <i>do not feed at all</i>.</p>

<p>4. Feed swarms, if unseasonable weather
immediately follow the act of swarming.</p>

<p>5. Preserve the Bees of weak stocks, and
prevent a great deal of the necessity for feeding,
by adding them to those that are rich and
able to support them. This last is the best
and cheapest, nay&mdash;it is even a <i>profitable</i>
method of feeding Bees.</p>

<p>Early swarming, where swarming is necessary
as in the straw-hive colonies, is of great advantage
to the watchful apiarian, but not to the
inattentive and slothful manager. I have seen
in a cottager's garden a swarm of Bees on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"> 198 </a></span>
the 10th of May, which was considerably
weaker in the month of August, than was a
swarm on the 10th of July, and that solely
on account of not being fed and properly
attended to.</p>

<p>If early swarms are judiciously fed, and
supported by a natural heat within, they will
be greatly benefitted thereby, and eventually
prosper.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding what has been already
said, the cottager may probably ask&mdash;"how
can I feed my Bees without lifting up their
hive?" I again and again request him to
examine my collateral box-hive; and he will
perceive that he may easily feed the Bees
in his cottage-hive in the same easy manner,
if he have but ingenuity enough to attach a
proper feeder to the stool or floor of his hive.</p>

<p>Mr. Huish advises apiarians to make choice
of a fine and warm day in which to feed
Bees, he says, the danger to be apprehended
from the change of the temperature in the hive
will thereby be obviated. This, I grant, is
rational and humane, and in some degree a
confirmation of my already expressed opinion,
respecting the mischiefs resulting from the
inconsiderate practice of exposing the interior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"> 199 </a></span>
of a hive to sudden and extreme alternations
of temperature. But it matters not what sort
of weather it may be, if my mode of feeding
be adopted. I feed my Bees in their native
temperature, without disturbing them or exposing
their food to the temptation of robbers,
which feeding in the ordinary way so frequently
encourages, during the spring and autumnal
seasons; and it is at these times that Bees
stand in most need of assistance.</p>

<p>In the year 1828, I purchased a cottage-hive
of a neighbour, it was a large hive, and well-stocked
with Bees, but extremely light; I was
fearful for the safety of its inmates, and,
therefore, placed it over one of my feeders;
in order to give them support by feeding, I
placed the sirup intended for their food
beneath the hive; but to my great surprise
the Bees refused to take the proffered bounty.
I persevered in my endeavours to induce them
to feed for four days, but they would not
touch the well-intended boon: I therefore
resolved to ascertain the cause of their refusal,
and on turning up the hive I discovered
that thousands of the Bees were in a dying
state, I had the curiosity to take the whole
of them out singly. After several hours'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"> 200 </a></span>
particular attention and patient search, I found
the Queen was dead. I then united the weak,
enfeebled Bees to a rich stock, and they nearly
all recovered their strength. Their numbers
greatly assisted in the labour of the hive to
which they were joined. Certain it is, that if
any accident befal their Queen in winter, it is
total <i>ruin</i> to that stock of Bees: where such a
death is discovered, feeding will avail nothing,
the Bees dwindle away and perish.</p>

<p>Mr. Huish says&mdash;and he is perfectly correct
in saying&mdash;that there are some persons who
defer the feeding of their Bees until the moment
they suppose that they may be in actual want.
This is a most reprehensible plan; for should
feeding be too long delayed, the Bees will
become so weak and debilitated, that they
will be unable to convey the food into their
cells: the food ought to be administered to
poor stocks, three weeks or a month before
they may be supposed to be in actual want;
it will then be conveyed with the greatest
despatch into the cells, and the hive will be
saved from a death of famine. He then goes
on to observe&mdash;that some apiarians conceive
that the feeding of Bees in the spring renders
them lazy and inactive. On what this opinion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"> 201 </a></span>
is grounded he is at a loss to conjecture, as must
be every practical apiarian; for it is in direct contradiction,
not only to Mr. Huish's experience,
but also to that of many other apiarians.
A little food granted to a populous, and even
well-provisioned box or hive in the spring, is
attended with very beneficial consequences.
It diffuses animation and vigour throughout
the whole community;&mdash;it accelerates the
breeding of the Queen&mdash;and consequently
conduces to the production of early swarms,
where room is not previously given in order to
prevent swarming altogether.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="CHAPTER_XIVa" id="CHAPTER_XIVa"></a>BEE-FOOD.</p>

<p>Artificial food proper for Bees may be made
by mixing <i>coarse</i>, raw sugar, and good, sound
ale, in the following proportions:&mdash;</p>

<p>To a quart of ale add a pound and a half
of sugar, gently boil them, in a sweet, well-tinned
saucepan, over a fire clear from smoke,
for five or six minutes, or until the sugar be
dissolved and thoroughly incorporated with the
ale; and, during the process of boiling, skim
off the dross that rises to the surface. Some
persons boil these ingredients much longer,
and until they become, when cool, a thick,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"> 202 </a></span>
clammy sirup; this not only diminishes the
quantity of the mixture, but renders it rather
disadvantageous, to weak Bees in particular,
by clogging and plaguing them, if, as they
are almost sure to do, they get their legs or
wings daubed with it. I prefer sirup in a
more liquid state.</p>

<p>For spring feeding, I advise&mdash;that not more
than a pound of sugar be put to a quart of
ale, or sweet wort, if it can be obtained, and
that a small quantity of common salt be added.
By a <i>small quantity</i> I mean&mdash;a drachm or two
at the most to a quart of the sirup. Salt, it
has been said, is conducive to the health of
Bees, and the most efficacious remedy for
the dysentery, which sometimes affects Bees
in the spring; therefore, it may not be amiss
to put a little salt into their food, by way of
preventive, rather than to have recourse to it
afterwards as a remedy.</p>

<p>Speaking of the substances which are proper
for the feeding of Bees, Mr. Huish says<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>&mdash;"he
is perfectly convinced that honey alone
is very injurious to Bees, as it in general
gives them the dysentery." Whether by this
<i>extraordinary passage</i> Mr. Huish has, or has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"> 203 </a></span>
not, subjected himself to the lash of his own
ridicule, it would be hypercritical and unbecoming
in me to determine. As an apiarian
I respect him; in no other character am I
acquainted with him. His work on the
management of Bees I have read, and have
derived information and occasionally assistance
from some of its pages. There are in it,
nevertheless, several untenable positions, of
which I consider the above-quoted passage to
be one: and, if what he has remarked somewhat
sarcastically, in a note at the foot of
page 31, be read in conjunction with this
passage, it will be for the candid reader,
apiarian, or other, to decide whether Mr. Huish
in propri person does not, oddly enough,
exemplify his own remark. It is there said&mdash;that
"there is no wonder in nature which
an apiarian has not seen." Professedly an
apiarian himself, he must have seen some, at
least, of <i>the wonders in nature</i>, otherwise he
never could have been "<i>perfectly convinced</i>"&mdash;that
honey&mdash;"<i>honey alone</i>"&mdash;the very substance
which Bees, guided by the instinct of
their nature, collect with so much industry,
and store up with so much care, for their
subsistence, should be "very injurious to them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"> 204 </a></span>
and in general give them the dysentery."
From this it seems that the substance, which
is the natural food for one stock of Bees, is
physic for another, if not poison!! I cannot
but express my astonishment that a gentleman,
so acute and experienced as Mr. Huish
undoubtedly is, should have asserted in the
most unqualified manner&mdash;that "honey alone
is very injurious to Bees." Were this the
fact, rich stocks, and all stocks that subsist
upon "honey alone" during winter, would
"in general" be affected with dysentery in
the spring, which certainly is not the case.
"In general" rich stocks are healthy and
strong in the spring. Poverty is the predisposing
cause of dysentery among Bees: a
regular supply of their natural&mdash;their peculiar
food, does not induce dysentery or disease
of any sort. Had Mr. Huish analyzed the
honey given to Bees as food, and which
induced dysentery, he would, I suspect, have
discovered that it was not "honey alone," but&mdash;<i>medicated
honey</i>&mdash;<i>honey and brimstone</i>, or
honey strongly tinctured either with brimstone
or tobacco. That honey, tinctured with the
pernicious qualities of those substances, should
have a laxative effect upon impoverished,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"> 205 </a></span>
debilitated Bees, is no more than might be
expected: but then it is not the honey that
has the "injurious" effect, but the essence
of the brimstone or of the tobacco that is
administered along with it. What effect
honey, that has not been stoved and saturated
with brimstone or with tobacco, may have
upon <i>weak</i> Bees, when given to them for
<i>spring food</i>, I pretend not to determine,
because I have never tried the experiment.
But I do say that before the arrival of spring,
honey, that has been drained or expressed
from the comb, undergoes fermentation, and
that fermentation may, for aught I know,
impart to it physical properties, which in its
pure, liquid, unchanged state, in the warm
hive, it does not possess. I am not chemist
enough to venture to assert that it is so, but
I think it highly probable that fermentation
may alter the properties of honey, and perhaps
may render it unwholesome to Bees. But
fresh, unfermented honey, even that in the
blackest and oldest combs&mdash;the very refuse,
and all such as the cottage-housewife makes
into common mead, if spread upon large
dishes and placed in an apiary, will be banqueted
upon by the Bees in the most eager
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"> 206 </a></span>
manner, and is apparently much enjoyed by
them. They soon carry into their hives what
they do not consume on the spot, and suffer
no inconvenience whatever from the treat. I
have feasted my Bees in this way scores of
times, and esteem it the very best mode of
autumnal feeding, and the most profitable
way of disposing of broken combs and refuse
honey. "Honey alone" is the natural food of
Bees, and if given to them pure and untainted,
in its primitive, limpid state, so far from being
injurious, it is highly beneficial to them; of
this I have not the shadow of a doubt. For
autumnal feeding, I prefer honey to all other
substances, and recommend it as the most
proper food that can be given to them.</p>

<p>Of these some are valuable for the supply
of pabulum they afford Bees early in spring;
as <i>the white alyssum, broom, crocus, furze,
hazel, laurustinus, mezereon, ozier, plane-tree,
poplar-tree, snowdrop, sycamore-tree, the willow-tree,
&amp;c.</i> Others again are valuable on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"> 211 </a></span>
account of the lateness of the season that
Bees derive assistance from them; as <i>the
golden-rod, heath, ivy, laurustinus, mignionette,
ragweed, &amp;c.</i> Some abound with honey; as
<i>borage, buckwheat, burnet, coleseed, currant and
gooseberry-trees, heath, leek, mignionette, mustard,
onion, thyme, the blossoms of apple,
apricot, cherry, nectarine, pear, and plum-trees,
and the leaves of those trees remarkable for
what is called honey-dew, as the aspin, blackberry,
laurel, laurustinus, lime, maple, oak,
plane, poplar, and sycamore-tree.</i> Among
those that are rich in pollen, may be classed&mdash;<i>the
arbutus, ash, blackberry, box, chesnut,
cypress, elder, laurel, marsh-mallow, turnip, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The cultivation of some of the most valuable
of these is too-limited to be particularly
advantageous to Bees, as <i>alyssum, borage,
burnet, golden-rod, laurustinus, mezereon, mignionette,
&amp;c.</i> The most extensive and lasting
Bee-pasturage in this country is <i>clover, heath</i>,
and in my own immediate neighbourhood
<i>mustard</i>. In short, every one of the flowers,
&amp;c. mentioned in the foregoing catalogue, and
others innumerable, are in their turns resorted
to by Bees, and of course are more or less
advantageous to them.</p>

<p class="caption3">HONEY-COMB.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">To</span> excite our admiration of the industry and
ingenuity of Bees, we need only take into
our hands a piece of <i>honey-comb</i>, and examine
it attentively. Its neatness, its beauty, its construction,
the similarity and exact proportion
of its double web of cells, for a honey-comb
is, in fact, a web of cell-work on both sides,
are most admirable, and calculated to lead the
contemplative mind from nature's work up to
nature's God.</p>

<p>When a swarm of Bees is put into a hive,
or into a box, they immediately set about
constructing combs in it, and proceed in their
building work with a rapidity that is truly
astonishing. The cells that are opposite to
each other are advanced alike: the work on
one side is just as forward and in the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"> 213 </a></span>
state as that on the other side. In the cells
first finished the Queen begins to deposit her
eggs. In an incredibly short space of time,
an immense number of cells is completed, and
the Bees store pollen, farina, or Bee-bread,
(which are so many names for the same
substance) in some of those not already
occupied by eggs, and in others honey soon
becomes visible: all is activity, industry,
and apparently happiness. But, to come to
particulars:&mdash;</p>

<p>As Dr. Bevan, in the course of his <i>masterly</i>
chapter "on the Architecture of Bees," has
given an engraved representation of a piece of
honey-comb,&mdash;and as Mr. Huish also has given
a somewhat similar representation, but better
than Dr. Bevan's, inasmuch as it is more varied,
and shows the royal-cells in their different
stages to more advantage, and the drone-cells
likewise;&mdash;I cannot, perhaps, do the <i>honey-comb</i>
so much justice in any way, as by
presenting to my reader a copy of Mr. Huish's
piece of comb, which has been <i>greatly improved</i>
by the skilful hand of my engraver, and by
giving along with it Dr. Bevan's able description.
Though after all, a piece of <i>real comb</i>,
to look at and examine, is more beautiful and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"> 214 </a></span>
far better than any engraving possibly can be,
however cleverly it may be executed: and
therefore, notwithstanding the plate, I would
recommend it to my reader to procure a piece
of real honey-comb, and with it in his hand
read the following account, which is chiefly
from Dr. Bevan's pen.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 360px;">
<img src="images/page_213.png" width="360" height="437" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Royal-cells in different states of forwardness,
common-cells, and drone-cells, are intended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"> 215 </a></span>
to be severally represented in this plate. The
ranges forming the upper half, and marked&mdash;a.
are intended to represent common brood-cells
and honey-cells&mdash;most of them in an
empty state. The lower ranges, marked&mdash;b.
are drone-cells, and are represented as closed
up, and as they appear when full of brood.
Drone-cells, when filled with brood and sealed
up, present a fuller and more convex surface
than the cells containing common brood&mdash;these,
that is&mdash;the cells containing the brood
that becomes working Bees, are sometimes flat
and even, and sometimes rather concave. The
four large cells, attached perpendicularly to
the edge of the comb, and marked&mdash;c. d. e. f.
are royal-cells in different states of forwardness;
that marked&mdash;c. is similar in size and shape
to an acorn-cup, and is supposed to be quite
empty; that marked&mdash;d. is in a more advanced
state, and is supposed to contain a royal
embryo, in its <i>larva</i> state: the royal-cell,
marked&mdash;e. is considerably lengthened, narrowed,
and nearly closed, because the larva
it is supposed to contain is about to be
transformed into a royal nymph, in which
stage of its existence, as it does not require
the assistance of nurses or common Bees, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"> 216 </a></span>
closed up entirely, as in the royal-cell, marked&mdash;f.
In this closed cell it progresses from
nymph to Bee, and in due time&mdash;that is, in
about sixteen days from its being deposited as
an egg, it emerges a virgin Queen. When the
temperature of a hive, or pavilion of nature,
is at a proper height&mdash;namely, between 70 and
80 degrees, sixteen days is the period nature
requires for the production of a Queen-Bee,&mdash;twenty-one
for the perfection of a working
Bee,&mdash;and twenty-six for a drone Bee. But,
as Dr. Bevan very justly remarks, "the
development of each species proceeds more
slowly when the colonies are weak, or the air
cool,&mdash;and that when the weather is very cold
it is entirely suspended."</p>

<p>But to return from this short, though it is
hoped, not uninteresting digression, into which
the explanation of the Queen-cells has led us.</p>

<p>"The combs of the Bee-hive comprise a
congeries of hexagonal cells, formed by the
Bees, as receptacles for honey or for embryo
Bees. A honey-comb is allowed to be one
of the most striking achievements of insect
industry, and an admirable specimen of insect
architecture. It has attracted the admiration
of the contemplative philosopher in all ages,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"> 217 </a></span>
and awakened speculation, not only in the
naturalist, but also in the mathematician: so
regular, so perfect, is the structure of the cells,
that it satisfies every condition of a refined
problem in geometry. Still a review of their
proceedings will lead to the conclusion, as
Huber has observed, that, "the geometrical
relations, which apparently embellish the
productions of Bees, are rather the necessary
result of their mode of proceeding, than the
principle by which their labour is guided."
"We must therefore conclude, that Bees,
although they act geometrically, understand
neither the rules nor the principles of the arts
which they practise so skilfully, and that the
geometry is not in the Bee, but in the great
Geometrician who made the Bee, and made
all things in number, weight, and measure.</p>

<p>"Before the time of Huber, no naturalist
had seen the commencement of the comb, nor
traced the several steps of its progress. After
many attempts, he at length succeeded in
attaining the desired object; by preventing
the Bees from forming their usual impenetrable
curtain by suspending themselves from the
top of the hive; in short, he obliged them to
build upwards, and was thereby enabled, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"> 218 </a></span>
means of a glass window, to watch every
variation and progressive step in the construction
of a comb.</p>

<p>"<i>Each comb in a hive is composed of two
ranges of cells, backed against each other:
these cells</i>, looking at them as a whole, may
be said to <i>have one common base</i>, though no
one cell is opposed directly to another. This
base or partition, between the double row of
cells, is so disposed as to form a pyramidal
cavity at the bottom of each, as will be
explained presently. <i>The mouths of the cells</i>,
thus ranged on each side of a comb, <i>open
into two parallel streets</i> (there being a continued
series of combs in every well filled hive).
These streets are sufficiently contracted, to
avoid waste of room, and to preserve a proper
warmth, yet <i>wide enough to allow the passage
of two Bees abreast</i>. Apertures through
different parts of the combs are reserved to
form near roads, for crossing from street to
street, whereby much time is saved to the
Bees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"> 219 </a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Bees</i>, as has been already observed, <i>build
their cells of an hexangular form, having six
equal sides</i>, with the exception of the first or
uppermost row, the shape of which is an
irregular pentagon, the roof of the hive forming
one of the members of the pentagon.</p>

<p>"There are only three possible figures of the
cells," says Dr. Reid, "which can make them
all equal and similar, without any useless
interstices. These are&mdash;the equilateral triangle,
the square and the regular hexagon.
It is well-known to mathematicians, that there
is not a fourth way possible, in which a plane
may be cut into little spaces, that shall be
equal, similar, and regular, without having
any interstices." Of these three geometrical
figures, the hexagon most completely unites
the prime requisites for insect architecture.
The truth of this proposition was perceived
by Pappus, an eminent Greek philosopher and
mathematician, who lived at Alexandria, in
the reign of Theodosius the Great, and its
adoption by Bees, in the construction of
honey-comb, was noticed by that ancient
geometrician. These requisites are:&mdash;</p>

<p>"First, &OElig;conomy of materials. There are
no useless partitions in a honey-comb, each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"> 220 </a></span>
of the six lateral panels of one cell forms
also one of the panels of an adjoining cell;
and of the three rhombs which form the
pyramidal base of a cell, each contributes one
third towards the formation of the bases of
three opposing cells, the bottom or centre of
every cell resting against the point of union
of the panels that are at the back of it.</p>

<p>"Secondly, &OElig;conomy of room; no interstices
being left between adjoining cells.</p>

<p>"Thirdly, the greatest possible capacity or
internal space, consistent with the two former
desiderata.</p>

<p>"Fourthly, &OElig;conomy of materials and economy
of room produce economy of labour.
And in addition to these advantages, the
cells are constructed in the strongest manner
possible, considering the quantity of materials
employed. Both the sides and bases are
so exquisitely thin, that three or four placed
on each other are not thicker than a leaf
of common writing paper; each cell, separately
weak, is strengthened by its coincidence
with other cells, and <i>the entrance is fortified
with an additional ledge or border of wax</i>,
to prevent its bursting from the struggles
of the Bee-nymph, or from the ingress and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"> 221 </a></span>
<i>egress</i> of the labourers. This entrance border
is <i>at least three times as thick as the sides of
the cell</i>, and thicker at the angles than elsewhere,
which prevents the mouth of the cell
from being regularly hexagonal, though the
interior is perfectly so.</p>

<p>"Having just adverted to the ingenuity of
Bees in thickening, and thereby strengthening
the mouths of the cells, it may here be observed&mdash;that
<i>additional strength is also derived from
the Bees covering the whole surface of the combs,
but more particularly the edge of the cells,
with a peculiar kind of varnish</i>, which they
collect for the purpose. At first the combs
are delicately white, semi-transparent, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"> 222 </a></span>
exceedingly fragile, smooth but unpolished:
in a short time their surfaces become stronger,
and assume more or less of a yellow tint.
The deepening of the colour of honey-combs
has been supposed, by some, to be the effect
of age; and in part it may be: but it is principally
owing to the coat of varnish, with
which the Bees cover them. This varnish
strongly resembles propolis, appearing to
differ from it only in containing the colouring
material which imparts to wax its yellow hue.
The source of this colouring matter has not
been discovered: it is insoluble in alcohol, but
the manufacture of white-wax shows that it
is destructible by light. But to return to the
construction of the cell-work.</p>

<p>"<i>The pyramidal basis of a cell is formed
by the junction of three rhomboidal or lozenge-shaped
portions of wax:</i> the apex of the
pyramid being situated where the three obtuse
angles of the lozenges meet. To the exterior
edges and angles are attached the six panels
or sides of each cell. The apex of each
pyramidal bottom, on one side of a comb,
forms the angles of the bases of three cells
on the opposite side, the three lozenges respectively
concurring in the formation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"> 223 </a></span>
bases of the same cells. This will, I hope,
explain what is meant by "each cell separately
weak, being strengthened by coincidence with
others." The bottom of each cell rests upon
three partitions of opposite cells, from which
it receives a great accession of strength.</p>

<p>"As it is desirable that the reader should
thoroughly comprehend this subject, I will
re-state it in other words. The partition which
separates the two opposing rows of cells, and
which occupies, of course, the middle distance
between their two surfaces, is not a plane but
a collection of rhombs, there being three at
the bottom of each cell: the three together
form in shape, a flattened pyramid, the basis
of which is turned towards the mouth of the
cell; each cell is in form, therefore, a hexagonal
prism, terminated by a flattened trihedral
pyramid, the three sides of which pyramid
are rhombs, that meet at the apex by their
obtuse angles.</p>

<p>"The union of the lozenges in one point, in
addition to the support which it is the means of
affording to the three partitions between opposing
cells, is also admirably adapted to receive
the little egg and to concentrate the heat
necessary for its incubation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"> 224 </a></span></p>

<p>"Each obtuse angle of the lozenges or rhombs
forms an angle of about 110 degrees, and
each acute one, an angle of about 70 degrees.
Mr. Maraldi found by mensuration that the
angles of these rhombs, which compose the
base of a cell, amounted to 109 degrees and
28 seconds, and 70 degrees and 32 seconds:
and the famous mathematician Koenig, pupil
of the celebrated Bernoulli, having been
employed for that purpose by M. Reaumur,
has clearly shown, by the method of infinitesimals,
that the quantity of these angles, using
the least possible wax, in the cell of the same
capacity, should contain 109 degrees and 26
seconds, and 70 degrees and 34 seconds. This
was confirmed by the celebrated Mr. Mac
Laurin, who very justly observes, that Bees
do truly construct their cells of the best figure,
and with the utmost mathematical exactness.</p>

<p>"The construction of several combs is
generally going on at the same time. No
sooner is the foundation of one laid, with a
few rows of cells attached to it, than a second
and a third are founded on each side, parallel
to the first, and so on, (if the season give
encouragement to the operations of the Bees,)
till the hive is filled with their works; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"> 225 </a></span>
first constructed comb or combs being always
in the most advanced state, and therefore the
first to be completed.</p>

<p>"<i>The design of every comb is sketched out,
and the first rudiments are laid by one single
Bee.</i> This founder-Bee forms a block, out of
a rough mass of wax, drawn partly from its
own resources, but principally from those of
other Bees, which furnish materials, in quick
succession, from the receptacles under their
bellies, taking out the plates of wax with their
hind feet, and carrying them to their mouths
with their fore feet, where the wax is moistened
and masticated, till it becomes soft and ductile.</p>

<span class="i0">Their glossy burdens to the builder throng.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="tdr2"><span class="smcap">Evans.</span></p>
</div>

<p>"The architect-in-chief, who lays, as it
were, the first stone of this and each successive
edifice, determines the relative position
of the combs, and their distances from each
other: these foundations serve as guides for
the ulterior labours of the wax-working Bees,
and of those which sculpture the cells, giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"> 226 </a></span>
them the advantage of the margin and angles
already formed.</p>

<p>"The expedients resorted to by that ingenious
naturalist, Huber, unfolded the whole
process. He saw each Bee extract with its
hind feet one of the plates of wax from under
the scales where they were lodged, and carrying
it to the mouth in a vertical position,
turn it round, so that every part of its border
was made to pass in succession, under the
cutting edge of the jaws; it was thus soon
divided into very small fragments; and a
frothy liquor was poured upon it from the
tongue, so as to form a perfectly plastic mass.
This liquor gave the wax a whiteness and
opacity which it did not possess originally,
and at the same time renders it tenacious and
ductile. The issuing of this masticated mass
from the mouth was, no doubt, what misled
Reaumur, and caused him to regard wax as
nothing more than digested pollen.</p>

<p>"The mass of wax, prepared by the assistants,
is applied by the architect-Bee to the roof
or bottom of the hive, as the case may be;
and thus a block is raised of a semi-lenticular
shape, thick at top and tapering towards the
edges. When of a sufficient size, a cell is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"> 227 </a></span>
sculptured on one side of it, by the wax-working
Bees, who relieve one another in
succession, sometimes to the number of twenty,
before the cell is completely fashioned. At
the back and on each side of this first cell,
two others are sketched out and excavated.
By this proceeding the foundations of two
cells are laid, the line betwixt them corresponding
with the centre of the opposite cell. As
the combs extend, the first excavations are
rendered deeper and broader; and when a
pyramidal base is finished, the Bees build up
walls from its edges, so as to complete what
may be called the prismatic part of the cell.
Every succeeding row of cells is formed by
precisely similar steps, until there is a sufficient
scope for the simultaneous employment of
many workers.</p>

<p>"The pyramidal bases and lateral plates are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"> 228 </a></span>
successively formed, with surprising rapidity;
the latter are lengthened as the comb proceeds,
for the original semi-lenticular form is preserved
till towards the last, when, if the hive or box
be filled, the sides of all the cells receive such
additions as give them equal depth.</p>

<p>"<i>The cells intended for the drones</i> are considerably
larger, and more substantial, than
those for the working Bees, and, being later
formed, usually appear near the bottom of
the combs. Last of all, are built the <i>royal-cells</i>,
the cradles of the infant Queens: of
these there are usually three or four, and
sometimes ten or twelve, in a hive, attached
commonly to the central part, but not unfrequently
to the edge or side of the comb.
Mr. Hunter says that he has seen as many as
thirteen royal-cells in a hive, and that they
have very little wax in their composition, not
one third, the rest he conceives to be farina.
Such is the genuine loyalty of Bees, that the
wax which they employ with so much geometric
economy, in the construction of hexagonal
cells, is profusely expended on the mansion of
the royal Bee-nymph, one of these exceeding
in weight a hundred of the former. They are
not interwoven with them, but suspended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"> 229 </a></span>
perpendicularly, their sides being nearly parallel
to the mouths of the common-cells, several

<p>"The form of these royal-cells is an oblong
spheroid, tapering gradually downwards, and
having the exterior full of holes, somewhat
resembling the <i>rustic</i> work of stone buildings.
The mouth of the cell, which is always at its
bottom, remains open till the maggot is ready
for transformation, and is then closed as the
others are.</p>

<p>"Immediately on the emergence of a ripened
Queen, the lodge which she inhabited is
destroyed, and its place is supplied by a range
of common cells. The site of this range may
always be traced, by that part of the comb
being thicker than the rest, and forming a
kind of knot; sometimes the upper portion of
the cell itself remains, like an inverted acorn-cup,
suspended by its short peduncle.</p>

<p>"In this mutilated state only, and not in
the breeding-season, could Mr. Hunter have
seen this cradle of royalty; for he describes
it as the half of an oval, too wide and shallow
to receive its supposed tenant.</p>

<p>"I have spoken of the perfect regularity in
the cell-work of a honey-comb;&mdash;particular
circumstances, however, induce a departure
from this exactness: for instance, where Bees
have commenced a comb with small cell-work,
and afterwards wish to attach to it a set of
large cells, as in the case of drone-cells being
required to be appended to workers'-cells.
These deviations from the usual regularity
renew our admiration of Bee-ingenuity, though
Reaumur and Bonnet have regarded them as
examples of imperfection. They effect their
object by interposing three or four series of,
what may be called, <i>cells of transition</i>, the
bottom or bases of which are composed of
two rhombs and two hexagons, instead of
three rhombs; the rhombs and hexagons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"> 231 </a></span>
gradually varying in form and relative proportion,
till the requisite size, namely, that
of the cells which they are approaching, has
been attained.</p>

<p>"The same gradation is observed when
returning to smaller cells. Every apparent
irregularity is therefore determined by a
sufficient motive, and forms no impeachment
of the sagacity of the Bee.</p>

<p>"The common breeding-cells of drones or
workers are occasionally (after being cleaned)
made the depositories of honey; but the cells
are never made so clean, as to preserve the
honey undeteriorated. The finest honey is
stored in new cells, constructed for the purpose
of receiving it, their configuration resembling
precisely the common breeding-cells: these
<i>honey-cells vary in size</i>, being made more or less
capacious, <i>according to the productiveness of
the sources from which the Bees are collecting,
and according to the season of the year:</i> the
cells formed in July and August vary in their
dimensions from those that are formed earlier;
being intended for honey only, they are larger
and deeper, the texture of their walls is thinner,
and they have more dip or inclination; this
dip diminishes the risk of the honey's running
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"> 232 </a></span>
out, which, from the heat of the weather, and
the consequent thinness of the honey, at this
season of the year, it might otherwise be
liable to do. <i>When the cells</i>, intended for
holding the winter's provision, <i>are filled, they
are always closed with waxen lids</i>, and never
re-opened till the whole of the honey in the
unfilled cells has been expended. The waxen
lids are thus formed;&mdash;the first Bees construct
a ring of wax within the verge of the cell, to
which other rings are successively added, till
the aperture of the cell is finally closed with
a lid composed of concentric circles.</p>

<p>"The brood-cells, when their tenants have
attained a certain age, are also covered with
waxen lids, like the honey-cells; the lids
differ a little, the latter being somewhat concave,
the former convex. <i>The depth of the
brood-cells</i> of drones and working Bees is
about half an inch; <i>their diameter</i> is more
exact, that of the drone-cells being three lines<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>

and one third, that of the workers two lines
and three fifths. These, says Reaumur, are
the invariable dimensions of all the cells, that
ever were, or ever will be made.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[J]</span></a> A line is the twelfth part of an inch.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a name="CHAPTER_XVIa" id="CHAPTER_XVIa">BEES' WAX.</a></p>

<p>BEES' WAX, in its strictest sense, <i>is a
secretion from the body of the Honey-Bee</i>, and
is that peculiar substance or material with
which Bees principally construct their combs;&mdash;I
say&mdash;<i>principally</i>, because the foundation
of every comb is <i>propolis:</i> it is by this tenacious
substance (propolis) that combs are securely
attached to, and suspended from, the roof of
a hive or a box,&mdash;and it is by this that they
are firmly glued to the sides, wherever they are
made to touch them.</p>

<p>BEES' WAX, however, in the common
acceptation of the term, is that well-known,
valuable article, obtained from honey-comb by
the following process:&mdash;</p>

<p>Having <i>drained</i> all the honey from the
combs, put them into a clean pot, together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"> 234 </a></span>
with as much rain-water as will make them
float; then simmer over a clear fire until the
combs be completely dissolved; and the wax
and the dross mixed with it will swim at the
top of the water. Pour the whole into a
strong and tolerably fine canvas bag, made
wide at the top and tapering downwards to a
point, in the form of a jelly bag. Hold this
over a tub or large vessel in which is a quantity
of cold water. The boiling water will, of
course, soon drain through, and leave in the
bag the greater part of the liquefied wax
commingled with dross. Have ready then a
piece of smooth board of such a length that,
when one end of it is placed in the tub of
cold water, the other end may be conveniently
rested against, and securely stayed by your
breast. Upon this inclined plane lay your
dripping, reeking strainer, and keep it from
slipping into the cold water by bringing its
upper part over the top of the board so as to
be held firmly between it and your breast. If
the strainer be made with a broad hem round
its top, a piece of strong tape or cord passed
through such hem will draw it close, and
should be long enough to form a stirrup for
the foot, by which an additional power will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"> 235 </a></span>
gained of keeping the scalding-hot strainer
in its proper place on the board: then by
compressing the bag, or rather its contents,
with any convenient roller, the wax will ooze
through and run down the board into the cold
water, on the surface of which it will set in
thin flakes. When this part of the operation
is finished, collect the wax, put it into a clean
saucepan, in which is a little water to keep
the wax from being burnt to the bottom; melt
it <i>carefully</i> (for, should it be neglected and
suffered to boil over, serious mischief might
ensue, liquid wax being of a very inflammable
nature) therefore melt it <i>carefully over a slow
fire</i>, and skim off the dross as it rises to the
top; then pour it into such moulds or shapes
as your fancy may direct, having first well
rinsed them, in order that you may be able to
get the wax, when cold and solid, out of them
without breaking either the moulds or the wax:
place them, covered over with cloths or with
pieces of board, where the wax will cool slowly;
because the more slowly it cools the more solid
it will be and free from flaws and cracks. You
will thus have your wax in cakes, which may
be rendered still more pure by a second melting
and moulding. If run into very thin cakes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"> 236 </a></span>
and afterwards exposed to the influence of
the sun and the air, frequently turned, and
occasionally wetted, it will lose its yellowness,
and become beautifully white. This last
process is called <i>bleaching</i>; and, though more
simple and practicable than that pursued in
establishments where large quantities of wax
are bleached&mdash;where bleaching wax is of
itself a regular business&mdash;it may probably be
sufficient to answer all the purposes for which
<i>white-wax</i> is wanted in private families. I
have by me wax of my own bleaching that is
equal in whiteness and delicacy to any I have
ever met with.</p>

<p>Good wax is a heavy, solid substance, of a
deep yellow colour, has an agreeable, balsamic
odour, and possesses several medicinal and
other valuable qualities.</p>

<p>Combs that have never been filled, and those
that have been filled with honey only, afford
the best wax. Of the former kind but very
little need ever be taken from Bees in collateral-boxes;
and when any such combs are taken,
they may be far more advantageously disposed
of than by being melted down for the wax
they contain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"> 237 </a></span></p>

<p>Instead of crushing and melting all the
combs of three or four hives together, as is
mostly done by cottage Bee-keepers, the fine,
clean parts should be separated from those
that are discoloured, less pure, and inferior,
by reason of their age,&mdash;of having been brood
combs,&mdash;or of containing pollen, and should
be melted first. By this very easy mode of
manipulation, the quantity of wax would not
be lessened, and the superior quality of the
fine would command a price that would be an
ample remuneration for the additional trouble
attending the management of it in this way.</p>

<p>Should the preceding directions be thought
to be tediously or unnecessarily minute, my
apology for making them so is&mdash;an anxious
wish on my part to render every thing relating
to Bees clearly understood&mdash;understood so as
to be set about and properly managed by
persons who never before bestowed one
thought upon the subject.</p>

<p class="caption3">WINTER SITUATION FOR BEES.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">There</span> is no part of Bee-management more
utterly disregarded by cottage-hive Bee-keepers
than that which relates to a proper situation
for store-hives during winter. From whatever
cause this inattention may proceed,&mdash;whether
from custom, ignorance, or prejudice, it is
much to be regretted; because nothing is so
essentially conducive to the future prosperity,
and often to the very preservation, of a colony,
as due attention to its winter situation. Left,
as stock-hives commonly are, in their summer
aspect, and to stand upon the very spot they
have occupied ever since the day of their existence
as stocks,&mdash;with their entrances wide open,
just as they were in summer,&mdash;exposed alike
to every change of weather and to every attack
of prowling enemies; or, if covered at all, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"> 239 </a></span>
is mostly with a rude coat of straw, or reed,
or such material as affords to mice, vermine,
and various sorts of Bee-enemies, shelter and
concealment, and, in fact, encouragement to
attack and destroy the hives. Thus, neglected
and unheeded, it is no wonder that so many
stocks of Bees perish in the winter and spring
of every year; the wonder rather is that any
should escape.</p>

<p>Some apiarian authors are opposed to the
confinement of Bees in their hives, except
when snow is on the ground: <i>then</i>, and <i>then
only</i>, they recommend the confinement of Bees
as necessary for their safety. Now, I would
respectfully ask&mdash;if, in the North of England
and in Scotland, snow does not lie on the
ground for weeks, and in some years for months
together? and I would ask further&mdash;if Bees can
bear this confinement with snow on the ground,
why they cannot bear it when there is no snow?
They argue, however, in the face of this admission,
that confinement is injurious to Bees,
and that a flight in the open air on a fine day,
if there should happen to be a fine day, in
the depth of winter, is beneficial to Bees,
otherwise, they say, the Bees would not take
it. A mild, open winter, every body knows,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"> 240 </a></span>
renders unconfined Bees poor&mdash;and when kept
in a state of perpetual agitation and alarm by
the restless enemies that surround them and
nestle in their straw covering, and tempted by
the faint, wintery sun-beams that gleam upon
their floor-board through the unclosed entrance
of their hives, they will, no doubt, sometimes
sally forth. But what is the consequence?
Hundreds and thousands of them become
paralyzed<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> and never return; and those that
do get home again have occasion for food: of
course, the oftener these winter flights take
place, the more the population of the hives
they issue from is diminished, and the more
pauperized that diminished population becomes
in consequence of such flights: whereas, if
Bees were confined, kept in darkness, or, at
any rate, out of the influence of the sun, kept
dry, cool, still, and undisturbed, no such disastrous
consequences would ensue.</p>

<p>The following detail will show my readers
the results of some experiments, relative to
the aspect and situation of Bee-hives during
winter; and whilst in some degree they corroborate
the foregoing observations, they may
perhaps induce those, who are anxious for the
prosperity of their Bees, to submit to be
taught a useful lesson respecting the winter
management of them.</p>

<p>In 1824 I had six cottage-hives, which had
prospered well with me during the summer of
that year. In the autumn of the same year I
resolved to weigh those six hives, and to place
three of them on the north side of my house,
and to let the other three remain in their
summer situation. The separate weights of
my hives, in November of the year 1824, were
as under, viz.</p>

<p>The first three of these Nos. viz. 1, 2, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"> 242 </a></span>
the winter in their summer situation: Nos. 4,
5, and 6, weighing together 111 lbs. were
removed to a cold dry place, on the north side
of my house. On the 26th of March, 1825,
I again weighed those six hives, and found
their respective weights to be as follows, viz.</p>

<p>So that the three hives, remaining in their
summer quarters during the winter, had decreased
in weight just 63 lbs. being on an
average 21 lbs. each; while the three which
had wintered on the north side of my house
had decreased only 15 lbs. being on an
average only 5 lbs. each. This gives an
average difference of 16 lbs. a hive, between a
proper and an improper winter situation and
aspect for Bees. It is lamentable to think
how many people lose their Bees, either from
ignorance, prejudice, or want of attention to
this particular point&mdash;<i>a proper winter situation</i>.</p>

<p>I need scarcely relate to my readers, that
the Bees which were placed fronting, or open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"> 243 </a></span>
to the north, were the first that swarmed the
next spring. They swarmed in the month of
May; while those hives that had remained
fronting, or open to the south, did not swarm
until July; and one hive (No. 2.) never
swarmed at all during the season. At the
latter end of October, 1825, I again weighed
my hives, and found them to be as under:&mdash;</p>

<p>Hence it appears that the three hives (Nos.
1, 2, and 3) that had never been removed
from their summer stands, were 33 lbs. lighter
than when I first weighed them, that is, on
an average, 11 lbs. a hive; and even with the
weight of their two swarms added to them,
there was a falling off in the year of 9 lbs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"> 244 </a></span>
or, on an average, of 3 lbs, a hive: whilst
Nos. 4, 5, and 6, had gained 17 lbs. or, on an
average, nearly 6 lbs. each; and with the
weight of their swarms added to them, they
had gained 107 lbs. or, on an average, nearly
36 lbs. a hive in the year.</p>

<p>I could carry this subject much further in
my explanations, as I did in my experiments,
but it requires no facts in addition to those
just stated to explain the difference of aspect
in the winter-season to Bees.</p>

<p>Every cottager must know that the richer
his Bees are in spring, the sooner they will
swarm. Then, to make them rich, he must
not neglect to place his hives out of the influence
of the sun during winter,&mdash;<i>in a dry, cold,
and quiet situation</i>. He will find by this
practice, that not more than five or six pounds
of honey will be consumed by a good stock;
but if he suffer his Bees to remain fronting the
south, they will in a mild winter, if they survive
it at all, become paupers before spring.</p>

<p>Now what is proper during the winter for
stocks in common hives, is equally proper for
stocks in collateral-boxes, of which the
middle-box is the winter-pavilion or stock-hive.
Long before winter all the Bees of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"> 245 </a></span>
most populous stock will draw into the middle-box
and cluster round their Queen; and when
that is the case, the dividing-tins should be
put down, in order that all the Bees may be
securely kept in the pavilion; and previously
to removing them from their summer situation,
the entrance should be carefully closed with
a piece of wire-cloth, or perforated tin; which,
whilst it admits fresh air into the box, will
keep the Bees within and all their enemies
without. It is hardly possible for the smallest
enemy to make its way into a box thus secured.
A perforated tin may also be put over
the way down into the drawer. Towards
spring this last may be withdrawn, and the
Bees, when they begin to revive, will soon rid
themselves of those that may have died in the
winter, by carrying them down into the drawer.
Having made every necessary preparation,
remove your stocks to such a situation as that
herein before recommended, and there in
quietude let them pass the dreary months of
winter. I do not advise that they be taken
too early to, nor that they remain too long in,
their hibernacula: generally speaking, they
may be removed towards the latter end of
November, and again in the third or fourth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"> 246 </a></span>
week of February; but the Bees themselves,
if duly observed, will be the best directors.</p>

<p>This is <i>my</i> practice, and it is also the
practice of my apiarian friend at Gedney-Hill,
than whose, no stocks in this neighbourhood
are more healthy or much more prosperous.</p>

those who are qualified by their means, abilities,
and powers of patronage, to set the
example, and thereby influence others, will
effect this to a considerable extent, as far as
the production of honey and wax is concerned,
will, I think, be sufficiently obvious to those
who have witnessed, or who hereafter may
witness, the successful results&mdash;the almost
incredible quantity of these productions from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"> 248 </a></span>
my apiary alone; or, leaving my apiary entirely
out of the account, I will venture modestly
to assert, <i>that from any one set of collateral-boxes,
well-stocked and well-managed, the
quantity and quality of honey that may be
annually taken, without either destroying or
impoverishing the Bees, must be seen to be
believed; and being seen, will not be disputed</i>.
The exact amount annually paid to other
countries for these two commodities&mdash;honey
and wax&mdash;I have not the means of ascertaining
with accuracy, but it is probable that it
exceeds 350,000.&mdash;a sum lost to this country,
because, not only have we in the vegetable
world a profusion of these productions, that
"waste their sweetness on the desert air," but
we have, or might have, if we would but
encourage them, the labourers necessary to
collect them, and this too without the deterioration
of any other department of rural
economy. Were Bee-colonies multiplied to any
thing like the number that the Bee-pasturage
of this country would support; were there,
for instance, but one set of well-stocked collateral-boxes
on every square mile of England,
Wales, and Scotland,&mdash;or, to compute moderately,
on every square mile of every rural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"> 249 </a></span>
district of Great Britain, that is fertile in
Bee-pasturage,&mdash;and were the price of the
finest box-honey reduced to a shilling a pound,
the annual <i>surplus</i> produce of these colonies
would realize a sum far exceeding 350,000.
which would be put into the pockets of, generally
speaking, an industrious and deserving
part of the community&mdash;the rural population,
and a profitable remuneration given to them for
their indulgence and perseverance in a most
rational pursuit, requiring but trifling, and
this only incidental attention. I know of no
time more proper for throwing out these hints
than the present, when the subject of <i>rural
allotments</i> excites, and that justly, almost
universal attention amongst those desirous of
securing an industrious, prosperous, and virtuous
peasantry.</p>

<p>I do not presume to imagine that, antiquated
as are the practices hitherto so generally
adopted, and so pertinaciously adhered to in
Bee-management in this country, and characterized
as are these practices by so many
superstitious and irrational usages&mdash;I do not
presume to imagine that my system will, at
once, up-root prejudices, dispel superstitions,
and be immediately and heartily adopted by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"> 250 </a></span>
the cottager. The generality of apiarians have
yet to be taught that <i>Bee-management is a
system;</i>&mdash;that it is something more than
merely stocking a hive or box with a swarm
of Bees, and then leaving it to chance alone
to prosper or to perish; and, if to prosper, it
is only until the time for its final doom&mdash;the
reckless destruction of every Bee&mdash;arrives.
They have yet to learn that the whole, or at
least, the greater part of the contingencies,
to which Bee-colonies are subject, may be
averted; that the casualties of Bees are
analogous to those of other descriptions of
stock; and that, if they would ensure success,
or expect to derive profit from them, it must
be by attention to their domicils, to their
protection from the variations of climate and
atmosphere, and from external enemies,&mdash;in
short, by proper management. If in many
instances, the success of my hives has been
so unqualified and extensive, it has been
because the necessity for careful management
has been impressed and adhered to, and
because Bees, in whose welfare their owners
had been previously uninterested, have been
looked upon with some degree of attention,
and their labours facilitated and requited by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"> 251 </a></span>
timely administering to their wants and comforts.
In the same way, I believe, that by
attention to the observations contained in
these pages, the cottagers' labours may be
more amply repaid, and that more honey may
be obtained, even by their rough practices;
whilst this will be preparing them for the
adoption of my improved plans and gradually
pave the way for its general introduction.
For this I more particularly refer to the preceding
chapter, and to that on Bee-feeding,
i. e. chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_XIV">XIV.</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII">XVII.</a></p>

<p>It has often been suggested to me, to point
out <i>how</i> the culture of Honey-Bees might be
more generally extended in this country, and
rendered more advantageous to the cottager
than it has been hitherto. As regards the
extension of Bee-cultivation, I would observe,
that if those gentlemen, especially those
gentlemen resident in the country, who possess
affluence, influence, and leisure, would undertake
to promote it&mdash;would set the example
and keep Bees, their example alone would go
far to induce the cottager to keep them; and
that, as other countries boast, and that so
usefully, their apiarian societies, the formation
of such a society, or societies, could not fail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"> 252 </a></span>
to be attended with beneficial effects. Some
feeble attempts, it is true, to establish such a
society have been made, but have proved
abortive, whilst premiums on the subject have
been offered by other societies,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> injudiciously,
as they have tended to perpetuate mistaken
views, and to retard the progress of more
correct ones. I am not insensible of the
extreme benefit which has resulted to the
different branches of industry, and to agriculture
and horticulture in particular, by well-regulated
scales of premiums, emulating to
superiority and necessarily promoting a beneficial
stimulus in the different branches with
which they are connected. And, in my
opinion, nothing would more easily tend to
the inculcation of sounder views of practice,
than, if gentlemen, pursuing my principles,
would interest themselves in connecting with
the objects of such associations more generally,
graduated scales of prizes, regulated by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"> 253 </a></span>
quantity of honey obtained from stocks, the
prosperity of the hives afterwards, and the
state of the apiary generally, &amp;c. Were they
also to countenance the plan of placing colonies
under the care of labouring cottagers,
giving them premiums as an inducement to
careful management, they could not fail of
conferring a benefit, by initiating them into
the plans of the system, as well as by more
advantageously dividing the pasture of the
district among the different hives, and thereby
rendering the labour of their collecting the
stores considerably less to the Bees. This
would, undoubtedly, effect much, but I know
of no means so decidedly calculated to foster
and encourage the culture of Honey-Bees
among all classes, and more particularly among
the population of rural districts, as apiarian
societies, formed for the express purpose of
extending and improving the cultivation and
management of Honey-Bees.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[M]</span></a> A premium was last year (1833) awarded by the Cambridgeshire
Horticultural Society, to a Mr. Widnal, for his
exhibition of a glass of honey. But whether the encouragement
of Bee-culture be an object of that very respectable
society,&mdash;or whether the reward given to Mr. Widnal on
that occasion was a sort of bye-premium, bestowed for the
gratification of seeing a curiosity, it did not appear.</p>

<p class="caption3">MISCELLANEOUS DIRECTIONS.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">In</span> undertaking this work, as I originally did,
at the pressing solicitations of several of those
Noblemen and Gentlemen, whose names graced
the list of the subscribers for the first edition,
I had two main objects in view; of which a
full and particular explanation of the mode of
managing Honey-Bees, in my boxes and upon
my principles, was one,&mdash;and the other, which
I do ardently hope will result from the adoption
and encouragement of my long-tried plan,
is&mdash;the prospective improvement, not only of
the culture and condition of those ingenious,
admired, and most interesting little creatures,
but also of honey and wax&mdash;the two valuable
articles which Bees, and Bees alone, afford us.
To prepare the way for the accomplishment of
the latter of these objects, I have exerted my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"> 255 </a></span>
best endeavours&mdash;I have spared neither pains
nor expense, to give minute, and, I trust, intelligible
descriptions of all my boxes and hives,
of my Bee-machinery, and of every thing
thereto pertaining; which descriptions have
been accompanied with such practical directions
and relations of experiments, as will, <i>if
duly attended to</i>, enable my Bee-friends to put
their apiaries upon my <i>humane and profitable
system of management</i>. Therefore I do not
think it is incumbent upon me to proceed
farther at present. I might easily double the
size of my book, by entering into and giving
lengthy details of several matters relative to
Bees, which are not here so much as hinted
at; such, for instance, as the distance that
they sometimes fly from their hives in quest
of honey, and the experiments that have been
made to determine that distance;&mdash;the nature
of honey-dew, and how it is occasioned,&mdash;why
it abounds on some trees and plants, whilst
others are entirely destitute of it,&mdash;whether
it be a natural exudation of the plants that
afford it,&mdash;or whether it be produced by the
leaf-lice, called aphides;&mdash;why, if the impregnation
of a Virgin-Queen be retarded beyond
a certain number of days after her coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"> 256 </a></span>
into existence, all the eggs she lays during
her whole life, should invariably produce
<i>drones;</i>&mdash;the language of Bees, for Bees, it
has been held, have their peculiar language,
though I profess not to understand it, nor
even to have studied it, my business being
with their <i>habits;</i>&mdash;the various diseases or
maladies with which skilful men assure us
they are occasionally affected;&mdash;their senses,
their anatomy, and their instinct;&mdash;their affinity
to the wasp;&mdash;exotic Bees from those of
Lapland to those of China; and from those of
Siberia to those of the Cape of Good Hope;&mdash;the
stingless Bees of South America, mentioned
by Dr. Hancock, that from the luxuriant
ever-blooming, tropical plants and flowers,
produce black wax;<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> what Aristotle hath
remarked on one subject,&mdash;what Pliny hath
said on another,&mdash;what classic Virgil hath so
delightfully sung of the nature, economy, and
management of Bees in Italy,&mdash;what Gelieu
in modest prose hath said of Bees in Switzerland,&mdash;Huber
and Reaumur in France, and a
host of writers in Germany, and in our own
native England; what opposite opinions have
been entertained respecting honey; whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"> 257 </a></span>
plants and flowers secrete pure honey, or
whether the saccharine matter culled from
them undergoes any percolating, rectifying,
chemical process in the stomach of the Bee.&mdash;I
might observe, that the illustrious Hunter
was of opinion that it undergoes no change;
although the no less illustrious naturalist
Reaumur, and the entomologists Kirby and
Spence, imagine that some change does take
place before the honey is stored in the cells,&mdash;that,
as the nectarious exudation of plants is
not of the same consistence as honey from
the hives, it is reasonable to suppose that it
undergoes some change <i>in transitu</i> whilst in the
body of the Bee; that, as far as my experience
has enabled me to make observations on this
subject, I am disposed to lean to the opinion
of Reaumur, Kirby, and Spence, and to ascribe
the difference between honey in the nectarium
of a flower or on the leaf of a tree, and honey
in the cells of a comb, to the absorption of
the volatile parts of the saccharine of the plants
and flowers whilst in the honey-bag; which
absorption is aided and accelerated by the
natural heat of the Bee, and by which process
honey is rendered of uniform consistence,
in the graphic language of my chemical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"> 258 </a></span>
friend&mdash;Mr. Booth&mdash;I might exclaim, "How
necessarily do the least valued products in the
economy of nature, eliminated in the most
miniature laboratory of her operations, confirm
us in the belief of the existence, wisdom, and
power of nature's God&mdash;the Great Chemist&mdash;who
has not only imbued matter to act upon
its fellow matter in the infinity of space, to
produce an infinite diversity of changes in
the material world; but, within the small
compass of a Bee, has provided apparatus for
certain changes to take place, which are more
elaborate, important, and complicated, than
are produced in the largest apparatus of the
manufacturer! In this little insect are performed
all those chemical processes of life, by
which nature is kept in the equanimity and
beauty of existence&mdash;here composition and
decomposition, solution and precipitation,
sublimation, volatilization, distillation, and
absorption, through the agency of heat and
attraction, take place on the minutest matters,
secreted by the plants and collected by the
Bees; and in the hive, by the concentration
of their individual efforts, is elaborated that
immense quantity of those important products,
which constitute such useful commodities in
the arts and economy of life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"> 259 </a></span></p></div>

<p>The discussion of some of these topics, and
dissertations on others, might be made amusing,
perhaps interesting, and would, at all events,
swell the size of my book; but whether I
should thereby enhance its intrinsic merits (if
intrinsic merit it possess) is more than I dare
venture to affirm. In short, these topics come
not within my plan,&mdash;they are foreign to it,
and I gladly leave them to be treated of by
others, whose learning is mare able to cope
with them, and whose taste may direct them
to such subjects. <i>I have withheld nothing
that I deem to be essentially necessary to the
thorough understanding of my mode of Bee-management;</i>
consequently, I anticipate that
my two main objects will eventually be attained&mdash;that
Bee-culture will become a pleasing
and a profitable study&mdash;a source of instructive
amusement and of profit too,&mdash;and that our
country will, at no great distance of time, be
everywhere studded and ornamented with
neat, well-ordered apiaries. I will, therefore,
now close my present labours with a few miscellaneous
directions, chiefly recapitulatory,
which, on account of their importance, every
apiarian should constantly bear in mind.</p>

<p>Have your Bee-boxes <i>well-made</i>, and <i>of
good substantial materials</i>. Strength and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"> 260 </a></span>
durability are of greater consequence than
neatness, though that need not be neglected&mdash;neatness
and strength are not incompatible&mdash;they
may be combined.</p>

<p>Paint your boxes annually, when they are
in their winter situation.</p>

<p>Make a clear ground or floor-way from the
pavilion into each of the end-boxes, by cutting
away about two inches from the lower edge of
each of the corresponding ends, to the depth of
half an inch; and make this way or passage
as near the front-entrance as it conveniently
may be. This convenience has been suggested
to me <i>since</i> the directions for making collateral-boxes
were printed, and I therefore mention it
here as an improvement, because such a way
on the floor, and <i>without any climbing</i>, will
afford an additional accommodation to Bees
on many occasions.</p>

<p>Boxes will not work Bees, neither will Bees
work boxes to advantage, unless due attention
be paid to them&mdash;i. e. both to boxes and to
Bees.</p>

<p>Situation is of prime importance: for summer
it should be clear and open in front of
your boxes, and sheltered at their back by a
north-wall or by a thick hedge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"> 261 </a></span></p>

<p>In summer let their aspect be south-east:&mdash;early
in spring, and again in autumn, due south
is the best point to be in front: therefore, as
spring advances turn the front of your boxes
eastward, and as summer declines move them
back again to their spring aspect; or, in other
words, when there is not more than twelve
hours' sun, let the front of your boxes be due
south; and during the time that the sun is
more than twelve hours above the horizon, let
it be south-east.</p>

<p>Always have the cheerful rays of the morning
sun fall upon your boxes: but contrive to
throw a shade upon their front for a few hours
in the middle of the day, when the weather
is very hot. Such a shade will be grateful to
your Bees.</p>

<p>Elevate your boxes twenty inches or two
feet above the ground: and always keep the
grass or ground, under and near them, neat
and clean, and entirely free from all nuisances.</p>

<p>A constant supply of water in the immediate
vicinity of your apiary is highly desirable; if
therefore you have not a natural supply of
that element, <i>so necessary for Bees</i>, contrive
to let them have it by artificial means&mdash;by
placing it in or near your apiary, in large,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"> 262 </a></span>
shallow dishes, or in wooden troughs, partially
covering the surface with reed or moss, and
be careful to replenish them, so that your
Bees may always find it there.</p>

<p>Suffer not ants to burrow near your Bees.
Ants are enemies to Bees, and will annoy
them, if they get among them.</p>

<p>Spiders also are Bee-destroyers; therefore,
brush away their entangling webs, whenever
and wherever you find them about your boxes.</p>

<p>Fowls should not be permitted in an apiary.</p>

<p>Early in spring let the entrance be not more
than an inch, and increase it gradually to its
full extent, as you find occasion: contract it
again towards the fall of the year; and, if
the moths be troublesome in summer evenings,
nearly close it every evening; but take care
to open it again either early next morning, or
as soon as the evening flight of the moths is
over. This attention is more particularly due
to weak stocks, and affords them great protection
against the attacks of moths, which
are among the boldest, the most persevering,
and, when once they have got into a hive,
most destructive enemies to Bees.</p>

<p>Destroy wasps and wasps' nests wherever
you find them in the vicinity of your apiary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"> 263 </a></span>
The destruction of queen-wasps in spring is
the most effectual method of diminishing the
number of these formidable Bee-enemies;
because the destruction of a queen-wasp in
spring is tantamount to the destruction of a
whole nest afterwards.</p>

<p>Light in the domicil of Bees, if not
actually prejudicial to them, is, at any rate,
displeasing to them; therefore, be careful
never to expose your Bees unnecessarily to its
glare: never leave the window-doors open, nor
suffer careless visitors to do so.</p>

<p>My ingenious friend, the Rev. T. Clark, of
Gedney-Hill, suggests the propriety of recommending
that the window-doors be <i>self-shutting
doors</i>. This, he says, may be done by fixing
upon each door a light, easy spring, similar
to those made use of to shut doors in good
houses; or by a cord attached to each door,
and passed through an eye, and over a small
pulley fixed to the side of each box; from the
end of which cord a weight of two or three
ounces must be suspended. This weight,
acting upon the cord, will draw the little
doors to the windows, that is, it will shut
them. The cords, eyes, and pulleys, he
further says, may be so arranged, that one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"> 264 </a></span>
small weight will keep all the hive doors, in
a set of collateral-boxes, closed and safe, and
may be made to hang under the floor. I have
no hesitation in recommending his suggestion
as ingenious, practicable, and useful. The best
security, however, after all, is that afforded by
lock and key, the key being in the constant
possession of the owner.</p>

<p>Ventilate your collateral-boxes and bell-glasses,
when the interior temperature is at, or
above, 70 degrees.</p>

<p>Never irritate your Bees, nor offer any sort
of violence or opposition to them; and should
an angry Bee or two at any time attack you,
walk quietly away, and leave them to settle
into peace again.</p>

<p>On no account drive your Bees; it is a ruinous
practice. With boxes, however, I trust, it
is impracticable, and totally superseded.</p>

<p>Never disturb, nor in any way interfere with,
the middle-box.</p>

<p><i>On no account destroy any of your Bees:</i>
independently of its cruelty, it is an impolitic
practice: it is like cutting down a tree to get
at its fruit, which may easily be gathered by
less laborious and indestructive means. Encourage
your Bees,&mdash;accommodate them,&mdash;support
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"> 265 </a></span>
them,&mdash;and <i>by all means preserve them</i>;
and, when seasons are favourable, they will
<i>richly</i> reward you for your attention to them.</p>

<p>Always keep a cottage-hive, or single box
or two, in your apiary, for the purpose of
having swarms from them, with which to stock
empty boxes, or to strengthen such stocks as
may stand in need of additional numbers; and
proceed with such supplementary swarms as
directed in <a href="#Page_42">pages 42-45</a>.</p>

<p>Never impoverish your Bees by taking from
them more honey than they have to spare.
Always suffer them to be in possession of a
plentiful store. Over-deprivation distresses
them, and is no gain to the proprietor. Among
other reasons this is one for my repeated
directions&mdash;not to touch the middle-box.</p>

<p>Honey of the very finest quality may
commonly be obtained from collateral-boxes,
as early in the season as the months of May
and June, without injuring the parent-stock
in the slightest degree. The enlargement of
their domicil by returning an empty glass, or
an empty box, to the place from which a full
one has been taken, is at this busy period of
their labour an accommodation to Bees, and
is one great means of preventing the necessity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"> 266 </a></span>
for their swarming, as it enables them to continue
their work at the time that there is the
greatest abundance of treasure for them in
the fields, and when Bees in cottage-hives
cannot profit by it, owing to their want, not
of inclination to gather it, but of room in
their hive to store it; they therefore swarm
once, twice, perhaps three times. What
then can be afterwards expected from such
exhausted stocks but weakness and poverty?
The more numerous the working Bees are in
any colony, the more honey they will collect,
<i>provided they have room wherein to store it</i>.
Accommodate them, then, with convenient
store-room, and the more workers you have
in your boxes the better. Up to the middle
of August you may, with safety, that is,
without injury to the Bees, take off glasses
and boxes, as they become ready. <i>After that
time</i> it is advisable to have, and to leave, in
every colony, honey sufficient for the subsistence
of the Bees until next spring; and should
you take off a full box, later in the season than
the middle of August, instead of emptying it
of all its treasure, be content with a part of it,&mdash;take
a part, and <i>return a part&mdash;share it with
your Bees, and let their share be a liberal one</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"> 267 </a></span>
As has been already enjoined&mdash;<i>on no account
impoverish them by over-deprivation</i>, at that
precarious season especially. They possibly
may collect much honey after that time; if
so, share with them again; if not, have them
rich from your first bounty.</p>

<p>When a box, well-stored with honey, is
taken off, it is not an easy matter to extract
the first comb or two, without breaking them
and spoiling their beauty, besides shedding
more or less of the honey; therefore, be prepared
with proper knives. Any common
knife that has a blade long enough, may serve
to sever the combs from the sides of a box:
but, to cut them from the top, it is advisable
to have an instrument, which may be called
a Bee-knife, of the following construction:&mdash;a
two-edged, lancet-shaped blade, two inches
long and three-eighths of an inch broad,
having the hole, through which the rivet
would pass to fix it in a haft, drilled large
enough to admit the end of a steel rod, upon
which it is to be well brazed or riveted: the
other end of this rod may be finished with a
neat handle, leaving its clear length between
the contrate blade and the handle eleven
inches&mdash;that being rather more than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"> 268 </a></span>
depth of my Bee-boxes. A knife of this
description may easily be passed between the
combs, and is very convenient for cutting
them from the top of a box.</p>

<p>Whenever you have occasion to perform
any operation among your Bees, be provided
with every requisite material, implement, &amp;c.
Have not any thing to seek for, much less to
get made, at the moment it is wanted: <i>that
moment may perhaps be a critical one</i>.</p>

<p>In September unite the Bees of poor stocks
to rich ones; and now, or in March, transfer
stocks from straw-hives into boxes.</p>

<p>Previously to withdrawing the tin-divider,
for the purpose of opening the communication
into an end-box, take off the end-box and
dress its inside with a little liquid honey; this
will bring the Bees into it, when, but for the
honey, they would perhaps refuse to enter it;
and at that time close the ventilation. It is
wrong to ventilate empty boxes, because it
drives the Bees into the pavilion: and it is a
fact, that they will swarm from the pavilion,
rather than take possession of an empty
end-box, if its temperature be, and be kept,
disagreeably cold, by having the ventilation
open at the very time it should be carefully
closed. This will both explain and remedy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"> 269 </a></span>
the difficulty, that some apiarians complain of
having experienced, in getting their Bees to
take possession of an empty box; it will also
account for swarms sometimes leaving the
pavilion when there is no want of room: the
fact is&mdash;that the temperature of <i>that room</i> is
not agreeable to them: but it is owing to
the mismanagement of the apiator that it is
otherwise than agreeable.</p>

<p>Whenever a box is taken off, be careful to
open the perforations in the cylinder-ventilator,
many of which will be found sealed up with
propolis. These perforations may be cleared
at any time, by introducing a piece of wire
with a sharpened point, turned so as to pick
out the propolis; but they are most effectually
opened when a box is off.</p>

<p>Towards the latter end of November, or
earlier, if the weather be inclement and severe,
remove your Bee-boxes to their winter situation:
this should be <i>dry, quiet, cool</i>, and <i>dark</i>,
and place your boxes in it so that they may
front towards the north or north-east.</p>

<p>Guard and close the entrance with a piece
of fine wire-cloth, of Lariviere's patent tin,
or of perforated zinc, (which is the best, on
account of its not corroding) made fast to the
box, either of which will confine the Bees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"> 270 </a></span>
within their domicil, admit plenty of fresh air,
and keep out inimical intruders. Thus prepared
for winter, having every tin and block
in its proper place, <i>disturb your Bees as little
as possible</i>, and, come winter as it may, they
will pass it in that state of semi-insensibility,
or torpor, which nature, or with reverence let
me rather say&mdash;nature's God has appointed
for them.</p>

<p>Towards the end of February, or as soon
as vegetation begins to make its appearance,
take your boxes from their winter to their
summer stands, and commence another course
of attentions, observations, and humane management,
similar to that herein directed and
explained. And, though cases may arise,
and difficulties occur in the course of your
practice, for the remedying of which no specific
directions are, or can be, here given, your own
experience and progressive improvement in the
pleasing science of Bee-management, will lead
you to adopt the proper mode of treating the
former, and the proper means for surmounting
the latter.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
